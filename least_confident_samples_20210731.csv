618,[!] Induction and regulation of the carcinogen-metabolizing enzyme CYP1A1 by marijuana smoke and delta (9)-tetrahydrocannabinol.,11245634,,2001,"Induction of the carcinogen-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) is a key step in the development of tobacco-related cancers. To determine if marijuana smoke activates CYP1A1, a murine hepatoma cell line expressing an inducible CYP1A1 gene (Hepa-1) was exposed in vitro to tar extracts prepared from either tobacco, marijuana, or placebo marijuana cigarettes. Marijuana tar induced higher levels of CYP1A1 messenger RNA (mRNA) than did tobacco tar, yet resulted in much lower CYP1A1 enzyme activity. These differences between marijuana and tobacco were primarily due to Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC), the psychoactive component of marijuana. Here we show that Delta(9)-THC acts through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor complex to activate transcription of CYP1A1. A 2-microg/ml concentration of Delta(9)-THC produced an average 2.5-fold induction of CYP1A1 mRNA, whereas a 10- microg/ml concentration of Delta(9)-THC produced a 4.3-fold induction. No induction was observed in Hepa-1 mutants lacking functional aryl-hydrocarbon receptor or aryl-hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator genes. At the same time, Delta(9)-THC competitively inhibited the CYP1A1 enzyme, reducing its ability to metabolize other substrates. Spiking tobacco tar with Delta(9)-THC resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the ability to generate CYP1A1 enzyme activity as measured by the ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (EROD) assay.

Increased delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentrations in cannabis may lead to higher THC exposure, cannabis dependence and treatment need, but users may also adapt the actual intake of THC through reduced inhalation of THC containing smoke (titration). We investigated whether consumers of stronger cannabis use less cannabis per joint or inhale less smoke than those using less potent cannabis and whether these factors predict cannabis dependence severity. METHODS. Heavy cannabis users (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰98) brought their own cannabis, rolled a joint and smoked it ad libitum in a naturalistic setting. We analysed the content of the joint, its association with smoking behaviour and the cross-sectional and prospective (1.5-year follow-up) relations between smoking behaviour and cannabis dependence severity (total number of DSM-IV dependence symptoms). RESULTS. THC concentration in cannabis (range 1.10-24.70%) was correlated positively with cannabis dose per joint (bвЂ‰=вЂ‰0.008, PвЂ‰=вЂ‰0.01), but the resulting THC concentration per joint (range 0.24-15.72%) was associated negatively with inhalation volume (bвЂ‰=вЂ‰-0.05, PвЂ‰=вЂ‰0.03).

Monthly THC dose only predicted follow-up dependence severity when unadjusted for baseline severity. CONCLUSIONS. Cannabis users titrate their delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol intake by inhaling lower volumes of smoke when smoking strong joints, but this does not fully compensate for the higher cannabis doses per joint when using strong cannabis.

656,[!] Prenatal cannabinoid and gene expression for neural adhesion molecule L1 in the fetal rat brain.,15068010,,2003,"The consumption by women of cannabis derivatives during pregnancy and/or lactation affects the development of their offspring because like other psychoactive drugs, cannabinoids, the psychoactive ingredients of marijuana, can cross the placental barrier and be secreted into the maternal milk. Through this way, cannabinoids are able to affect the expression of key genes for neural developmental leading to neurotransmitter and behavioral disturbances. In this present study, we wanted to explore the influence of prenatal cannabinoid exposure on the gene expression of a key protein for brain development, the neural adhesion molecule L1, which plays an important role in processes of cell proliferation and migration, neuritic elongation and guidance, and synaptogenesis. To this end, pregnant rats were daily treated with delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta9-THC) since the 5th day of gestation up to the day before birth (GD21), day at which rats were killed and their pups removed for analysis of L1-mRNA levels in different brain structures. Our results confirmed that the levels of L1 transcripts were significantly increased after prenatal delta9-THC exposure in several regions such as the fimbria, stria terminalis, stria medullaris and corpus callosum, which share the properties of being white matter regions and containing, exclusively during development, an abundant population of cannabinoid CB1 receptors, the major targets for the action of plant-derived cannabinoids. L1-mRNA levels were also increased in grey matter structures such as the septum nuclei and the habenula, but remained unchanged in most of the grey matter structures analyzed (cerebral cortex, basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, hippocampus, thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei, basal ganglia and subventricular zones) and also in a few white matter structures (fornix and fasciculus retroflexus). An important aspect of these observations is that the increase in L1-mRNA levels reached statistical significance only in the case of delta9-THC-exposed males but not in the case of delta9-THC-exposed females where only trends or no effects were detected, this supporting previous evidence on a sexual dimorphism, with greater effects in male fetuses, for the action of cannabinoids in the developing brain.

Purified cannabinoids have been reported to prevent proliferation, metastasis, and induce apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell types. However, the active compounds from Cannabis sativa flowers and their interactions remain elusive. Research Aim: This study was aimed to specify the cytotoxic effect of C. sativa-derived extracts on colon cancer cells and adenomatous polyps by identification of active compound(s) and characterization of their interaction. Materials and Methods: Ethanol extracts of C. sativa were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry and their cytotoxic activity was determined using alamarBlue-based assay (Resazurin) and tetrazolium dye-based assay (XTT) on cancer and normal colon cell lines and on dysplastic adenomatous polyp cells.

758,[!] Cannabidiol induces programmed cell death in breast cancer cells by coordinating the cross-talk between apoptosis and autophagy.,21566064,,2011,"Cannabidiol (CBD), a major nonpsychoactive constituent of cannabis, is considered an antineoplastic agent on the basis of its in vitro and in vivo activity against tumor cells. However, the exact molecular mechanism through which CBD mediates this activity is yet to be elucidated. Here, we have shown CBD-induced cell death of breast cancer cells, independent of cannabinoid and vallinoid receptor activation. Electron microscopy revealed morphologies consistent with the coexistence of autophagy and apoptosis. Western blot analysis confirmed these findings. We showed that CBD induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and, subsequently, inhibits AKT and mTOR signaling as shown by decreased levels of phosphorylated mTOR and 4EBP1, and cyclin D1. Analyzing further the cross-talk between the autophagic and apoptotic signaling pathways, we found that beclin1 plays a central role in the induction of CBD-mediated apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Although CBD enhances the interaction between beclin1 and Vps34, it inhibits the association between beclin1 and Bcl-2. In addition, we showed that CBD reduces mitochondrial membrane potential, triggers the translocation of BID to the mitochondria, the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol, and, ultimately, the activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in breast cancer cells.

Cannabidiol (CBD), a major nonpsychoactive constituent of cannabis, is considered an antineoplastic agent on the basis of its in vitro and in vivo activity against tumor cells. However, the exact molecular mechanism through which CBD mediates this activity is yet to be elucidated. Here, we have shown CBD-induced cell death of breast cancer cells, independent of cannabinoid and vallinoid receptor activation. Electron microscopy revealed morphologies consistent with the coexistence of autophagy and apoptosis. Western blot analysis confirmed these findings. We showed that CBD induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and, subsequently, inhibits AKT and mTOR signaling as shown by decreased levels of phosphorylated mTOR and 4EBP1, and cyclin D1. Analyzing further the cross-talk between the autophagic and apoptotic signaling pathways, we found that beclin1 plays a central role in the induction of CBD-mediated apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.

780,[!] О”вЃ№-tetrahydrocannabinol (О”вЃ№-THC) exerts a direct neuroprotective effect in a human cell culture model of Parkinson's disease.,22236282,,2012,"OBJECTIVE. О”вЃ№-tetrahydrocannabinol (О”вЃ№-THC) is neuroprotective in models of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although CB1 receptors are increased within the basal ganglia of PD patients and animal models, current evidence suggests a role for CB1 receptor-independent mechanisms. Here, we utilized a human neuronal cell culture PD model to further investigate the protective properties of О”вЃ№-THC. METHODS. Differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were exposed to PD-relevant toxins: 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), lactacystin and paraquat. Changes in CB1 receptor level were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Cannabinoids and modulatory compounds were co-administered with toxins for 48 h and the effects on cell death, viability, apoptosis and oxidative stress assessed. RESULTS. We found CB1 receptor up-regulation in response to MPP+, lactacystin and paraquat and a protective effect of О”вЃ№-THC against all three toxins. This neuroprotective effect was not reproduced by the CB1 receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 or blocked by the CB1 antagonist AM251. Furthermore, the antioxidants О±-tocopherol and butylhydroxytoluene as well as the antioxidant cannabinoids, nabilone and cannabidiol were unable to elicit the same neuroprotection as О”вЃ№-THC. However, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARОі) antagonist T0070907 dose-dependently blocked the neuroprotective, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects of О”вЃ№-THC, while the PPARОі agonist pioglitazone resulted in protection from MPP+-induced neurotoxicity. Furthermore, О”вЃ№-THC increased PPARОі expression in MPP+-treated SH-SY5Y cells, another indicator of PPARОі activation. CONCLUSIONS.

Another cohort was injected with vehicle or THC, and sperm DNAm was analyzed. Finally, THC-exposed and control adult male rats were mated with THC-naГЇve females. DNAm levels of target genes in brain tissues of the offspring were determined by pyrosequencing. RRBS identified 2,940 DM CpGs mapping to 627 genes. Significant hypermethylation was confirmed (pвЂ‰<вЂ‰0.05) following oral THC administration for cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (Por), involved in toxin processing and disorders of sexual development. Por hypermethylation was not observed after THC injection or in the subsequent generation. These results support that THC alters DNAm in sperm and that route of exposure can have differential effects.

Here, utilizing a unique mouse model based on host (DISC1) X environment (THC administration) interaction, we aimed at studying the pathobiological basis through which THC exposure elicits psychiatric manifestations. Wild-Type and dominant-negative-DISC1 (DN-DISC1) mice were injected with THC (10вЂ‰mg/kg) or vehicle for 10 days during mid-adolescence-equivalent period. Behavioral tests were conducted to assess exploratory activity (open field test, light-dark box test) and cognitive function (novel object recognition test). Electrophysiological effect of THC was evaluated using acute hippocampal slices, and hippocampal cannabinoid receptor type 1 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels were measured. Our results indicate that THC exposure elicits deficits in exploratory activity and recognition memory, together with reduced short-term synaptic facilitation and loss of BDNF surge in the hippocampus of DN-DISC mice, but not in wild-type mice. Over-expression of BDNF in the hippocampus of THC-treated DN-DISC1 mice prevented the impairment in recognition memory. The results of this study imply that induction of BDNF following adolescence THC exposure may serve as a homeostatic response geared to maintain proper cognitive function against exogenous insult.

The inhibition of viral entry and thus spread is a plausible therapeutic avenue. SARS-CoV-2 uses receptor-mediated entry into a human host via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed in lung tissue as well as the oral and nasal mucosa, kidney, testes and gastrointestinal tract. The modulation of ACE2 levels in these gateway tissues may be an effective strategy for decreasing disease susceptibility. Cannabis sativa, especially those high in the anti-inflammatory cannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD), has been found to alter gene expression and inflammation and harbour anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties. However, its effects on ACE2 expression remain unknown. Working under a Health Canada research license, we developed over 800 new C. sativa cultivars and hypothesized that high-CBD C. sativa extracts may be used to down-regulate ACE2 expression in target COVID-19 tissues. Using artificial 3D human models of oral, airway and intestinal tissues, we identified 13 high-CBD C. sativa extracts that decrease ACE2 protein levels. Some C. sativa extracts down-regulate serine protease TMPRSS2, another critical protein required for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells.

With the current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is an urgent need for new therapies and prevention strategies that can help curtail disease spread and reduce mortality. The inhibition of viral entry and thus spread is a plausible therapeutic avenue. SARS-CoV-2 uses receptor-mediated entry into a human host via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed in lung tissue as well as the oral and nasal mucosa, kidney, testes and gastrointestinal tract. The modulation of ACE2 levels in these gateway tissues may be an effective strategy for decreasing disease susceptibility. Cannabis sativa, especially those high in the anti-inflammatory cannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD), has been found to alter gene expression and inflammation and harbour anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties. However, its effects on ACE2 expression remain unknown. Working under a Health Canada research license, we developed over 800 new C. sativa cultivars and hypothesized that high-CBD C. sativa extracts may be used to down-regulate ACE2 expression in target COVID-19 tissues. Using artificial 3D human models of oral, airway and intestinal tissues, we identified 13 high-CBD C. sativa extracts that decrease ACE2 protein levels. Some C. sativa extracts down-regulate serine protease TMPRSS2, another critical protein required for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. While our most effective extracts require further large-scale validation, our study is important for future analyses of the effects of medical cannabis on COVID-19. The extracts of our most successful novel high-CBD C. sativa lines, pending further investigation, may become a useful and safe addition to the prevention/treatment of COVID-19 as an adjunct therapy."

954,[!] A novel CB receptor GPR55 and its ligands are involved in regulation of gut movement in rodents.,21726355,,2011,"BACKGROUND. This study was to investigate the effects of the novel cannabinoid receptor G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) and its ligands O-1602 and cannabidiol (CBD) on gastrointestinal (GI) motility in rodents. METHODS. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used in vivo to produce the model of septic ileus. The intestinal motility was measured by recording myoelectrical activity of jejunum in rats, and by measuring GI transit with a charcoal marker in mice, in presence of O-1602 or CBD. Inflammatory response was assessed serologically and histologically. The expression and distribution of GPR55 in the different parts of rat intestine were investigated by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. In vitro, the effects of the drugs on the GI movement were investigated by measuring the contraction of the intestinal muscle strips in organ bath, and the intracellular responses of the muscle cells with microelectrode technique. RESULTS. G protein-coupled receptor 55 was expressed in different parts of rat intestine. Lipopolysaccharide significantly inhibited the intestinal motility, increased inflammatory cytokines and GPR55 expression.

Phytocannabinoids in Cannabis sativa have diverse pharmacological targets extending beyond cannabinoid receptors and several exert notable anticonvulsant effects. For the first time, we investigated the anticonvulsant profile of the phytocannabinoid cannabidivarin (CBDV) in vitro and in in vivo seizure models. METHODS. The effect of CBDV (1-100 ОјM) on epileptiform local field potentials (LFPs) induced in rat hippocampal brain slices by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) application or Mg(2+) -free conditions was assessed by in vitro multi-electrode array recordings. Additionally, the anticonvulsant profile of CBDV (50-200 mgВ·kg(-1) ) in vivo was investigated in four rodent seizure models: maximal electroshock (mES) and audiogenic seizures in mice, and pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and pilocarpine-induced seizures in rats. The effects of CBDV in combination with commonly used antiepileptic drugs on rat seizures were investigated. Finally, the motor side effect profile of CBDV was investigated using static beam and grip strength assays. RESULTS. CBDV significantly attenuated status epilepticus-like epileptiform LFPs induced by 4-AP and Mg(2+) -free conditions. CBDV had significant anticonvulsant effects on the mES (в‰Ґ100 mgВ·kg(-1) ), audiogenic (в‰Ґ50 mgВ·kg(-1) ) and PTZ-induced seizures (в‰Ґ100 mgВ·kg(-1) ). CBDV (200 mgВ·kg(-1) ) alone had no effect against pilocarpine-induced seizures, but significantly attenuated these seizures when administered with valproate or phenobarbital at this dose. CBDV had no effect on motor function. CONCLUSIONS. These results indicate that CBDV is an effective anticonvulsant in a broad range of seizure models. Also it did not significantly affect normal motor function and, therefore, merits further investigation as a novel anti-epileptic in chronic epilepsy models. BACKGROUND.

Medical cannabis (MC) is increasingly being used for treatment of chronic pain symptoms. Among patients there is also a growing preference for the use of MC to manage sleep problems. The aim of the current study was to examine the associations between use of whole plant cannabis and sleep problems among chronic pain patients. METHODS. A total of 128 individuals with chronic pain over the age of 50 years were recruited from the Rambam Institute for Pain Medicine in Haifa, Israel. Of them, 66 were MC users and 62 were non-users. Regression models tested the differences in sleep problems between the two groups. Furthermore, Pearson correlations between MC use measures (dose, length and frequency of use, number of strains used, tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol levels) and sleep problems were assessed among MC users. RESULTS. After adjustment for age, sex, pain level and use of sleep and anti-depressant medications, MC use was associated with less problems with waking up at night compared with non-MC use. No group differences were found for problems with falling asleep or waking up early without managing to fall back asleep. Frequent MC use was associated with more problems waking up at night and falling asleep. CONCLUSIONS. MC use may have an overall positive effect on maintaining sleep throughout the night in chronic pain patients.

We also demonstrated that these properties derive from its activity on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Оі, in particular at a regulatory site within this receptor type. In the present study, we wanted to further confirm this neuroprotective potential using an oral lipid formulation of VCE-003.2, developed to facilitate the clinical development of this phytocannabinoid derivative. To this end, we evaluated VCE-003.2, administered orally at two doses (10 and 20 mg/kg), to mice subjected to unilateral intrastriatal injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a classic model of inflammation-driven neuronal deterioration that recapitulates characteristics of PD. The administration of VCE-003.2 to these mice showed, as expected, poor activity in the different motor tests (rotarod, computer-aided actimeter) used in experimental parkinsonism, in general due to the lack of evident changes in these behaviors by LPS lesion. However, VCE-003.2, at 20 mg/kg, was highly active in improving the changes detected in LPS-lesioned mice in the cylinder rearing test. In addition, the histopathological analysis of the basal ganglia revealed a trend towards recovery at 20 mg/kg VCE-003.2 in the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-containing nigrostriatal neurons, as well as a complete reduction in the elevated LAMP-1 immunolabeling (reflecting autophagy impairment) caused by LPS lesion. These effects were not seen at 10 mg/kg. This was associated with a partial reduction in the intense glial reactivity provoked by LPS in the substantia nigra, in particular the astroglial reactivity labeled with glial fibrillary acidic protein. The analysis using qPCR in the striatum of proinflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor-О±, interleukin-1ОІ, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase-2, showed that the marked elevations provoked by the LPS lesion tended to be, in general, attenuated by VCE-003.2 treatment, with the greatest effects normally found with the highest dose of 20 mg/kg.

Cannabidiol has been reported to be a neuroprotectant, but the neuroprotective mechanism of cannabidiol remains unclear. We studied the neuroprotective mechanism of cannabidiol in 4-hour middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion mice. METHODS. Male MCA occluded mice were treated with cannabidiol, abnormal cannabidiol, anandamide, methanandamide, cannabidiol plus capsazepine, and cannabidiol plus WAY100135 before and 3 hours after MCA occlusion. The infarct size was determined after 24 hours (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining). Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured at, before and 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after MCA occlusion. RESULTS. Cannabidiol significantly reduced the infarct volume induced by MCA occlusion in a bell-shaped curve. Similarly, abnormal cannabidiol but not anandamide or methanandamide reduced the infarct volume.

Pharmacological inhibition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) induced reactive gliosis may represent a novel rationale to develop drugs able to blunt neuronal damage and slow the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cannabidiol (CBD), the main non-psychotropic natural cannabinoid, exerts in vitro a combination of neuroprotective effects in different models of Abeta neurotoxicity. The present study, performed in a mouse model of AD-related neuroinflammation, was aimed at confirming in vivo the previously reported antiinflammatory properties of CBD. METHODS. Mice were inoculated with human Abeta (1-42) peptide into the right dorsal hippocampus, and treated daily with vehicle or CBD (2.5 or 10 mg kg(-1), i.p.) for 7 days. mRNA for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was assessed by in situ hybridization. Protein expression of GFAP, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and IL-1beta was determined by immunofluorescence analysis. In addition, ELISA assay of IL-1beta level and the measurement of NO were performed in dissected and homogenized ipsilateral hippocampi, derived from vehicle and Abeta inoculated mice, in the absence or presence of CBD. RESULTS. In contrast to vehicle, CBD dose-dependently and significantly inhibited GFAP mRNA and protein expression in Abeta injected animals. Moreover, under the same experimental conditions, CBD impaired iNOS and IL-1beta protein expression, and the related NO and IL-1beta release. CONCLUSIONS.

1170,[!] A comparison of cannabidiolic acid with other treatments for anticipatory nausea using a rat model of contextually elicited conditioned gaping.,24595502,,2014,"BACKGROUND. The effectiveness of cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) was compared with other potential treatments for anticipatory nausea (AN), using a rat model of contextually elicited conditioned gaping reactions. OBJECTIVE. The potential of ondansetron (OND), О”(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), chlordiazepoxide (CDP), CBDA, and co-administration of CBDA and tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) to reduce AN and modify locomotor activity was evaluated. METHODS. Following four pairings of a novel context with lithium chloride (LiCl), the rats were given a test for AN. On the test trial, they received pretreatment injections of the following: vehicle, OND (0.1 or 1.0 mg/kg), THC (0.5 mg/kg), CBDA (0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg), CDP (1, 5, or 10 mg/kg) or co-administration of subthreshold doses of CBDA (0.1 Ојg/kg), and THCA (5 Ојg/kg). Immediately following the AN test trial in all experiments, rats were given a 15 min locomotor activity test. Finally, the potential of CBDA (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/kg) to attenuate conditioned freezing to a shock-paired tone was assessed. RESULTS. THC, CBDA, and CDP, but not OND, reduced contextually elicited gaping reactions.

1174,[!] Local administration of delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol attenuates capsaicin-induced thermal nociception in rhesus monkeys: a peripheral cannabinoid action.,10353438,,1999,"BACKGROUND. Cannabinoids can reduce nociceptive responses by acting on peripheral cannabinoid receptors in rodents. OBJECTIVE. The study was conducted to evaluate the hypothesis that local administration of delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta9-THC) can attenuate capsaicin-induced nociception in rhesus monkeys. METHODS. Capsaicin (100 microg) was applied locally in the tail of rhesus monkeys to evoke a nociceptive response, thermal allodynia, in normally innocuous 46 degrees C water. delta9-THC (10-320 microg) was coadministered with capsaicin in the tail to assess local antinociceptive effects. In addition, a local antagonism study was performed to confirm the selectivity of delta9-THC action. RESULTS. delta9-THC dose-dependently inhibited capsaicin-induced allodynia. This local antinociception was antagonized by small doses (10-100 microg) of the cannabinoid CB1 antagonist, SR141716A, applied in the tail.

To assess the efficacy and safety profile of add-on cannabidiol (CBD) in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome (DS) on clobazam and in the overall population of four randomized, controlled phase 3 trials. METHODS. Patients received plant-derived, highly purified CBD medicine (Epidiolex-В® in the USA; Epidyolex-В® in Europe; 100В mg/ml oral solution) at a dose of 10 or 20В mg/kg/day, or placebo for 14В weeks. A subgroup analysis of patients on clobazam and meta-analysis by syndrome were conducted. The primary endpoint was percentage reduction in primary seizure type during the treatment period. RESULTS. 396 patients with LGS (49% on clobazam) and 318 patients with DS (64% on clobazam) were included. CBD treatment resulted in a reduction in primary seizure frequency vs placebo in the overall population (treatment ratio [95% confidence interval]: LGS, 0.70 [0.62-0.80]; DS, 0.71 [0.60-0.83]) and in patients receiving clobazam (LGS, 0.56 [0.47-0.67]; DS, 0.63 [0.52-0.77]).

RESULTS. 396 patients with LGS (49% on clobazam) and 318 patients with DS (64% on clobazam) were included. CBD treatment resulted in a reduction in primary seizure frequency vs placebo in the overall population (treatment ratio [95% confidence interval]: LGS, 0.70 [0.62-0.80]; DS, 0.71 [0.60-0.83]) and in patients receiving clobazam (LGS, 0.56 [0.47-0.67]; DS, 0.63 [0.52-0.77]). The antiseizure efficacy of CBD was also demonstrated across other endpoints vs placebo (в‰Ґ50% responder rate, total seizure frequency, number of seizure-free days, and Subject/Caregiver Global Impression of Change scores) in the overall populations and in patients receiving clobazam. There were higher incidences of somnolence and sedation in patients on CBD and clobazam. Most incidences of elevated transaminases occurred in patients on concomitant valproate and, to a lesser extent, clobazam. CONCLUSIONS. Add-on CBD was effective in reducing seizures in the overall populations and in conjunction with clobazam. Somnolence and sedation occurred more frequently in patients on CBD and clobazam."

Microparticles elaborated with a CBD:polymer ratio of 10:100 were selected due to the most suitable release profile with a zero-order CBD release (14.13В В±В 0.17В Ојg/day/10В mg Mps) for 40В days. The single administration of this formulation showed an in vitro extended antitumor activity for at least 10В days and an in ovo antitumor efficacy comparable to that of CBD in solution after daily topical administration (в‰€1.5-fold reduction in tumor growth vs control). The use of CBD in combination with paclitaxel (PTX) was really effective. The best treatment schedule was the preВ +В co-administration of CBD (10В ВµM) with PTX. Using this protocol, the single administration of microparticles was even more effective than the daily administration of CBD in solution, achieving a в‰€10- and 8- fold reduction in PTX IC-50 respectively. This protocol was also effective in ovo. While PTX conducted to a 1.5-fold tumor growth inhibition, its combination with both CBD in solution (daily administered) and 10-Mps (single administration) showed a 2-fold decrease. These results show the promising potential of CBD-Mps administered in combination with PTX for ovarian cancer treatment, since it would allow to reduce the administered dose of this antineoplastic drug maintaining the same efficacy and, as a consequence, reducing PTX adverse effects."
1388,[!] Exploring cannabis use by patients with multiple sclerosis in a state where cannabis is legal.,30502644,CBD; Cannabis; Marijuana; Multiple Sclerosis; THC,2019,"BACKGROUND. Studies suggest cannabis may improve symptoms like pain and muscle spasticity in patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Despite cannabis' new-found legality and availability, few studies have explored the profile of PwMS cannabis users and characteristics of their use, particularly in a state where cannabis is legal both for recreational and medicinal use. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate cannabis use among PwMS at a large academic multiple sclerosis (MS) clinic, specifically: (1) prevalence, (2) products used (e.g., cannabidiol vs О”-9-tetrahydocannabinol), (3) symptom treatment, and (4) patient characteristics. METHODS. PwMS completed questions assessing personal opinions about cannabis use, characteristics of cannabis use, MS history, and sociodemographic details, as well as the self-reported disability-Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS), overall quality of life-the Patient Reported Outcome Measure Information System (PROMIS-10), and cognition-the Neuro-QoL ACGC v1.0 measures. RESULTS. Thirty-eight percent (nвЂЇ=вЂЇ96) of PwMS were current Cannabis users (CUs). Although there were no sociodemographic or clinical differences (pвЂЇв‰¤вЂЇ0.05) between CUs and Non-Cannabis users (NUs), CUs had significantly higher median disability compared to NUs (PDDSвЂЇ=вЂЇ2вЂЇvs. 1; pвЂЇ=вЂЇ0.02). Among CUs, 57% categorized their use as strictly medicinal. CUs reported using cannabis most often for pain and insomnia/poor sleep and experienced greater than 60% benefit/relief from cannabis use. Over 90% of respondents desire more research on cannabis for MS, and 74% indicated they would consider using cannabis for their MS. CONCLUSIONS.

1395,[!] Antihyperalgesic effect of a Cannabis sativa extract in a rat model of neuropathic pain: mechanisms involved.,18618522,,2008,"This study aimed to give a rationale for the employment of phytocannabinoid formulations to treat neuropathic pain. It was found that a controlled cannabis extract, containing multiple cannabinoids, in a defined ratio, and other non-cannabinoid fractions (terpenes and flavonoids) provided better antinociceptive efficacy than the single cannabinoid given alone, when tested in a rat model of neuropathic pain. The results also demonstrated that such an antihyperalgesic effect did not involve the cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors, whereas it was mediated by vanilloid receptors TRPV1. The non-psychoactive compound, cannabidiol, is the only component present at a high level in the extract able to bind to this receptor: thus cannabidiol was the drug responsible for the antinociceptive behaviour observed. In addition, the results showed that after chronic oral treatment with cannabis extract the hepatic total content of cytochrome P450 was strongly inhibited as well as the intestinal P-glycoprotein activity. It is suggested that the inhibition of hepatic metabolism determined an increased bioavailability of cannabidiol resulting in a greater effect. However, in the light of the well known antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties of terpenes and flavonoids which could significantly contribute to the therapeutic effects, it cannot be excluded that the synergism observed might be achieved also in the absence of the cytochrome P450 inhibition.",Phytotherapy research : PTR,,Neuropathic pain,,cannabis,,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Compound: cannabis; Indication: Neuropathic pain,"Title: [!] Antihyperalgesic effect of a Cannabis sativa extract in a rat model of neuropathic pain: mechanisms involved.

BACKGROUND. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-intoxicating component of cannabis, or the psychoactive О”-9-tetrahydrocannabiol (THC), shows anti-hyperalgesia and anti-inflammatory properties. OBJECTIVE. The present study evaluates the anti-inflammatory and anti-hyperalgesia effects of CBD's potent acidic precursor, cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), in a rodent model of carrageenan-induced acute inflammation in the rat hind paw, when administered systemically (intraperitoneal, i.p.) or orally before and/or after carrageenan. In addition, we assess the effects of oral administration of THC or CBDA, their mechanism of action, and the efficacy of combined ineffective doses of THC and CBDA in this model. Finally, we compare the efficacy of CBD and CBDA. RESULTS. CBDA given i.p. 60В min prior to carrageenan (but not 60В min after carrageenan) produced dose-dependent anti-hyperalgesia and anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, THC or CBDA given by oral gavage 60В min prior to carrageenan produced anti-hyperalgesia effects, and THC reduced inflammation. The anti-hyperalgesia effects of THC were blocked by SR141716 (a cannabinoid 1 receptor antagonist), while CBDA's effects were blocked by AMG9810 (a transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 antagonist). In comparison to CBDA, an equivalent low dose of CBD did not reduce hyperalgesia, suggesting that CBDA is more potent than CBD for this indication.

Cannabinoids are neuroprotective in models of neurodegenerative dementias. Their effects are mostly mediated through CB1 and CB2 receptor-dependent modulation of excitotoxicity, inflammation, oxidative stress, and other processes. We tested the effects of SativexВ®, a mixture of О”9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, acting on both CB1 and CB2 receptors, in parkin-null, human tau overexpressing (PK-/-/TauVLW) mice, a model of complex frontotemporal dementia, parkinsonism, and lower motor neuron disease. The animals received SativexВ®, 4.63 mg/kg, ip, daily, for one month, at six months of age, at the onset of the clinical symptoms. We evaluated the effects of SativexВ® on behavior, dopamine neurotransmission, glial activation, redox state, mitochondrial activity, and deposition of abnormal proteins. PK-/-/TauVLW mice developed the neurological deficits, but those treated with SativexВ® showed less abnormal behaviors related to stress, less auto and hetero-aggression, and less stereotypy. SativexВ® significantly reduced the intraneuronal, MAO-related free radicals produced during dopamine metabolism in the limbic system. SativexВ® also decreased gliosis in cortex and hippocampus, increased the ratio reduced/oxidized glutathione in the limbic system, reduced the levels of iNOS, and increased those of complex IV in the cerebral cortex.

These children had failed to achieve seizure freedom with available treatment options and were ineligible to participate in randomized controlled trials that only included patients with Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndromes. METHODS. Cannabidiol safety, changes in seizure type, frequency, and seizure-free days were evaluated for children aged 1-18вЂЇyears (at time of consent) as an adjunctive treatment for 36вЂЇmonths. The study consisted of a two-month baseline period, a titration period, treatment period, and optional titration period, which occurred after в‰Ґ26вЂЇweeks of treatment. Cannabidiol treatment was administered up to a targeted dose of 25вЂЇmg/kg/day, with an optional secondary treatment up to 50вЂЇmg/kg/day. Daily seizure type, seizure frequency, and seizure-free days were recorded in a Web-based diary, and changes in these outcomes were recorded and analyzed for the duration of the study. The occurrence of adverse events (AEs) was also recorded. RESULTS. The median percentage change in seizures for 45 patients in Months 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 showed a statistically significant (pвЂЇ<вЂЇ0.001) reduction in major seizures (ranging from 54 to 72% at various time points) and all seizures (61-70%) compared with baseline. A mean increase in seizure-free days per 28вЂЇdays was >5 in all treatment periods after Month 2, and an average increase of 7.52 (pвЂЇ<вЂЇ0.001) seizure-free days per 28вЂЇdays was observed at the end of follow-up compared with baseline. All patients experienced в‰Ґ1 AE. Children who transitioned to the optional secondary treatment (high-dose group) reported more AEs before increasing their dose to >25.0вЂЇmg/kg/day compared with the low-dose group. However, the average rate of AEs was significantly lower after moving to a high-dose regimen (pвЂЇ=вЂЇ0.004). Twelve children reported 20 serious AEs, none of which were considered related to CBD.

1556,[!] Cannabinoid and Terpenoid Doses are Associated with Adult ADHD Status of Medical Cannabis Patients.,32017685,,2020,"OBJECTIVE. The aim of this cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was to identify associations between the doses of cannabinoids and terpenes administered, and symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS. Participants were adult patients licensed for medical cannabis (MC) treatment who also reported a diagnosis of ADHD by a physician. Data on demographics, ADHD, sleep, and anxiety were collected using self-report questionnaires. Data collected on MC treatment included administration route, cultivator, cultivar name, and monthly dose. Comparison statistics were used to evaluate differences in reported parameters between low (20-30 g, n=18) and high (40-70 g, n=35) MC monthly dose and low adult ADHD self-report scale (ASRS, 0-5) score (i.e. в‰¤3.17 score, n=30) or high ASRS score (i.e. в‰Ґ3.18 score, n=29) subgroups. RESULTS. From the 59 patients that answered the questionnaire, MC chemovar could be calculated for 27 (45%) of them. The high MC monthly dose group consumed higher levels of most phyto-cannabinoids and terpenes, but that was not the case for all of the cannabis components. The high dose consumers and the ones with lower ASRS score reported a higher occurrence of stopping all ADHD medications. Moreover, there was an association between lower ASRS score subgroup and lower anxiety scores. In addition, we found an association between lower ASRS score and consumption of high doses of cannabinol (CBN), but not with О”-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). CONCLUSIONS. These findings reveal that the higher-dose consumption of MC components (phyto-cannabinoids and terpenes) is associated with ADHD medication reduction.

1602,[!] Matched pilot study examining cannabis-based dronabinol for acute pain following traumatic injury.,32154376,,2020,"UNASSIGNED. To determine whether adjunctive dronabinol, a licensed form of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, reduces opioid consumption when used off-label for managing acute pain following traumatic injury. UNASSIGNED. This matched cohort study included patients who were admitted with a traumatic injury between 1 March 2017 and 30 October 2017. The hospital pharmacy database was used to identify patients who received dronabinol (cases), and they were matched 1:1 to patients who did not receive dronabinol (controls) using age, cause of injury and hospital length of stay. The primary outcome, change in opioid consumption, was calculated using morphine milligram equivalents (MME). The change in MME was calculated for cases as total MME over 48вЂ‰hours with adjunctive dronabinol minus 48вЂ‰hours prior to dronabinol, and for controls as total MME 48-96вЂ‰hours from admission minus 0-48вЂ‰hours from admission. Data are presented as mean and SE or median and IQR. Statistical analysis was performed using paired t-tests and McNemar's tests. UNASSIGNED. There were 66 patients included: 33 cases and 33 matched controls. Dronabinol was initiated 55 (28-107) hours from admission. Cases and controls were well matched. Cases had a significant reduction in opioid consumption with adjunctive dronabinol (-79 (20) MME, p<0.001), while opioid consumption was unchanged for controls (-9 (20) MME, p=0.63). This resulted in a ninefold greater reduction in opioid consumption for cases versus controls that was statistically different between pairs (p=0.02). Nineteen (58%) cases reported using marijuana; in this subset, opioid consumption was reduced with adjunctive dronabinol (-97 (24) MME, p<0.001) versus a non-significant increase in opioid consumption in matched controls (11 (29) MME, p=0.70); difference between groups, p=0.01.

О”9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is discussed as a neuroprotective agent in several in vitro and in vivo models of brain injury. However, the mechanisms by which THC exhibits neuroprotective properties are not completely understood. In the present study, we investigated neuroprotective mechanisms of THC in glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in primary murine mesencephalic cultures, as a culture model for PD. Glutamate was administered for 48вЂ‰h with or without concomitant THC treatment. Immunocytochemistry staining and resazurin assay were used to evaluate cell viability. Furthermore, superoxide levels, caspase-3 activity, and mitochondrial membrane potential were determined to explore the mode of action of this compound. THC protected dopaminergic neurons and other cell types of primary dissociated cultures from glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, THC significantly counteracted the glutamate-induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization and apoptosis. SR141716A, a CB-1 receptor antagonist, concentration-dependently blocked the protective effect of THC in primary mesencephalic cultures. In conclusion, THC exerts anti-apoptotic and restores mitochondrial membrane potential via a mechanism dependent on CB-1 receptor.

1711,[!] The endogenous cannabinoid system regulates seizure frequency and duration in a model of temporal lobe epilepsy.,12954810,,2003,"Several lines of evidence suggest that cannabinoid compounds are anticonvulsant. However, the anticonvulsant potential of cannabinoids and, moreover, the role of the endogenous cannabinoid system in regulating seizure activity has not been tested in an in vivo model of epilepsy that is characterized by spontaneous, recurrent seizures. Here, using the rat pilocarpine model of epilepsy, we show that the marijuana extract Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (10 mg/kg) as well as the cannabimimetic, 4,5-dihydro-2-methyl-4(4-morpholinylmethyl)-1-(1-naphthalenyl-carbonyl)-6H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-i,j]quinolin-6-one [R(+)WIN55,212 (5 mg/kg)], completely abolished spontaneous epileptic seizures. Conversely, application of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor (CB1) antagonist, N-(piperidin-1-yl-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamidehydrochloride (SR141716A), significantly increased both seizure duration and frequency. In some animals, CB1 receptor antagonism resulted in seizure durations that were protracted to a level consistent with the clinical condition status epilepticus. Furthermore, we determined that during an short-term pilocarpine-induced seizure, levels of the endogenous CB1 ligand 2-arachidonylglycerol increased significantly within the hippocampal brain region. These data indicate not only anticonvulsant activity of exogenously applied cannabinoids but also suggest that endogenous cannabinoid tone modulates seizure termination and duration through activation of the CB1 receptor. Furthermore, Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that CB1 receptor protein expression was significantly increased throughout the CA regions of epileptic hippocampi.

However, the anticonvulsant potential of cannabinoids and, moreover, the role of the endogenous cannabinoid system in regulating seizure activity has not been tested in an in vivo model of epilepsy that is characterized by spontaneous, recurrent seizures. Here, using the rat pilocarpine model of epilepsy, we show that the marijuana extract Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (10 mg/kg) as well as the cannabimimetic, 4,5-dihydro-2-methyl-4(4-morpholinylmethyl)-1-(1-naphthalenyl-carbonyl)-6H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-i,j]quinolin-6-one [R(+)WIN55,212 (5 mg/kg)], completely abolished spontaneous epileptic seizures. Conversely, application of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor (CB1) antagonist, N-(piperidin-1-yl-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamidehydrochloride (SR141716A), significantly increased both seizure duration and frequency. In some animals, CB1 receptor antagonism resulted in seizure durations that were protracted to a level consistent with the clinical condition status epilepticus. Furthermore, we determined that during an short-term pilocarpine-induced seizure, levels of the endogenous CB1 ligand 2-arachidonylglycerol increased significantly within the hippocampal brain region. These data indicate not only anticonvulsant activity of exogenously applied cannabinoids but also suggest that endogenous cannabinoid tone modulates seizure termination and duration through activation of the CB1 receptor. Furthermore, Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that CB1 receptor protein expression was significantly increased throughout the CA regions of epileptic hippocampi. By demonstrating a role for the endogenous cannabinoid system in regulating seizure activity, these studies define a role for the endogenous cannabinoid system in modulating neuroexcitation and suggest that plasticity of the CB1 receptor occurs with epilepsy."

1776,[!] A role for O-1602 and G protein-coupled receptor GPR55 in the control of colonic motility in mice.,23603203,,2013,"OBJECTIVE. The G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) is a novel cannabinoid (CB) receptor, whose role in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract remains unknown. Here we studied the significance of GPR55 in the regulation of GI motility. METHODS. GPR55 mRNA and protein expression were measured by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The effects of the GPR55 agonist O-1602 and a selective antagonist cannabidiol (CBD) were studied in vitro and in vivo and compared to a non-selective cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55,212-2. CB1/2(-/-) and GPR55(-/-) mice were employed to identify the receptors involved. RESULTS. GPR55 was localized on myenteric neurons in mouse and human colon. O-1602 concentration-dependently reduced evoked contractions in muscle strips from the colon (в€ј60%) and weakly (в€ј25%) from the ileum. These effects were reversed by CBD, but not by CB1 or CB2 receptor antagonists. I.p. and i.c.v. injections of O-1602 slowed whole gut transit and colonic bead expulsion; these effects were absent in GPR55(-/-) mice. WIN55,212-2 slowed whole gut transit effects, which were counteracted in the presence of a CB1 antagonist AM251. WIN55,212-2, but not O-1602 delayed gastric emptying and small intestinal transit. Locomotion, as a marker for central sedation, was reduced following WIN55,212-2, but not O-1602 treatment. CONCLUSIONS. GPR55 is strongly expressed on myenteric neurons of the colon and it is selectively involved in the regulation of colonic motility.

Here we studied the significance of GPR55 in the regulation of GI motility. METHODS. GPR55 mRNA and protein expression were measured by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The effects of the GPR55 agonist O-1602 and a selective antagonist cannabidiol (CBD) were studied in vitro and in vivo and compared to a non-selective cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55,212-2. CB1/2(-/-) and GPR55(-/-) mice were employed to identify the receptors involved. RESULTS. GPR55 was localized on myenteric neurons in mouse and human colon. O-1602 concentration-dependently reduced evoked contractions in muscle strips from the colon (в€ј60%) and weakly (в€ј25%) from the ileum. These effects were reversed by CBD, but not by CB1 or CB2 receptor antagonists. I.p. and i.c.v. injections of O-1602 slowed whole gut transit and colonic bead expulsion; these effects were absent in GPR55(-/-) mice. WIN55,212-2 slowed whole gut transit effects, which were counteracted in the presence of a CB1 antagonist AM251. WIN55,212-2, but not O-1602 delayed gastric emptying and small intestinal transit. Locomotion, as a marker for central sedation, was reduced following WIN55,212-2, but not O-1602 treatment. CONCLUSIONS. GPR55 is strongly expressed on myenteric neurons of the colon and it is selectively involved in the regulation of colonic motility. Since activation of GPR55 receptors is not associated with central sedation, the GPR55 receptor may serve as a future target for the treatment of colonic motility disorders."

Cannabidiol (CBD) is a phytocannabinoid, with anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects and has recently been shown to exert a tissue sparing effect during chronic myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion (I/R). However, it is not known whether CBD is cardioprotective in the acute phase of I/R injury and the present studies tested this hypothesis. METHODS. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received either vehicle or CBD (10 or 50 microg kg(-1) i.v.) 10 min before 30 min coronary artery occlusion or CBD (50 microg kg(-1) i.v.) 10 min before reperfusion (2 h). The appearance of ventricular arrhythmias during the ischaemic and immediate post-reperfusion periods were recorded and the hearts excised for infarct size determination and assessment of mast cell degranulation. Arterial blood was withdrawn at the end of the reperfusion period to assess platelet aggregation in response to collagen. RESULTS. CBD reduced both the total number of ischaemia-induced arrhythmias and infarct size when administered prior to ischaemia, an effect that was dose-dependent.

We investigated the effects of cannabidiol, a non-psychoactive constituent of Cannabis sativa with anti-inflammatory properties that activates the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 5-HT(1A) on brain and liver functions in a model of hepatic encephalopathy associated with fulminant hepatic failure induced in mice by thioacetamide. METHODS. Female Sabra mice were injected with either saline or thioacetamide and were treated with either vehicle or cannabidiol. Neurological and motor functions were evaluated 2 and 3 days, respectively, after induction of hepatic failure, after which brains and livers were removed for histopathological analysis and blood was drawn for analysis of plasma liver enzymes. In a separate group of animals, cognitive function was tested after 8 days and brain 5-HT levels were measured 12 days after induction of hepatic failure. RESULTS. Neurological and cognitive functions were severely impaired in thioacetamide-treated mice and were restored by cannabidiol. Similarly, decreased motor activity in thioacetamide-treated mice was partially restored by cannabidiol. Increased plasma levels of ammonia, bilirubin and liver enzymes, as well as enhanced 5-HT levels in thioacetamide-treated mice were normalized following cannabidiol administration. Likewise, astrogliosis in the brains of thioacetamide-treated mice was moderated after cannabidiol treatment. CONCLUSIONS. Cannabidiol restores liver function, normalizes 5-HT levels and improves brain pathology in accordance with normalization of brain function.

1869,[!] A novel component of cannabis extract potentiates excitatory synaptic transmission in rat olfactory cortex in vitro.,15234473,,2004,"Cannabis is a potential treatment for epilepsy, although the few human studies supporting this use have proved inconclusive. Previously, we showed that a standardized cannabis extract (SCE), isolated Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta9-THC), and even Delta9-THC-free SCE inhibited muscarinic agonist-induced epileptiform bursting in rat olfactory cortical brain slices, acting via CB1 receptors. The present work demonstrates that although Delta9-THC (1 microM) significantly depressed evoked depolarizing postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) in rat olfactory cortex neurones, both SCE and Delta9-THC-free SCE significantly potentiated evoked PSPs (all results were fully reversed by the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A, 1 microM); interestingly, the potentiation by Delta9-THC-free SCE was greater than that produced by SCE. On comparing the effects of Delta9-THC-free SCE upon evoked PSPs and artificial PSPs (aPSPs; evoked electrotonically following brief intracellular current injection), PSPs were enhanced, whereas aPSPs were unaffected, suggesting that the effect was not due to changes in background input resistance. Similar recordings made using CB1 receptor-deficient knockout mice (CB1-/-) and wild-type littermate controls revealed cannabinoid or extract-induced changes in membrane resistance, cell excitability and synaptic transmission in wild-type mice that were similar to those seen in rat neurones, but no effect on these properties were seen in CB1-/- cells. It appears that the unknown extract constituent(s) effects over-rode the suppressive effects of Delta9-THC on excitatory neurotransmitter release, which may explain some patients' preference for herbal cannabis rather than isolated Delta9-THC (due to attenuation of some of the central Delta9-THC side effects) and possibly account for the rare incidence of seizures in some individuals taking cannabis recreationally.",Neuroscience letters,,Epilepsy,,cannabis,,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Compound: cannabis; Indication: Epilepsy,"Title: [!] A novel component of cannabis extract potentiates excitatory synaptic transmission in rat olfactory cortex in vitro.

Delta(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol significantly decreased the rectal temperature, and the hypothermic effect was inhibited by SR141716. These results surely show that the neuroprotective effect of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol are via a CB1 receptor and temperature-dependent mechanisms whereas the neuroprotective effects of cannabidiol are independent of CB1 blockade and of hypothermia."
1912,[!] Adolescent THC exposure in female rats leads to cognitive deficits through a mechanism involving chromatin modifications in the prefrontal cortex.,29481316,,2017,"BACKGROUND. Increasing cannabis consumption among adolescents, studies that link its early use with mental illnesses, and the political debate on cannabis legalization together call for an urgent need to study molecular underpinnings of adolescent brain vulnerability. The emerging role of epigenetic mechanisms in psychiatric diseases led us to hypothesize that epigenetic alterations could play a role in causes and subsequent development of the depressive/psychotic-like phenotype induced by adolescent, but not adult, О”9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) exposure in female rats. METHODS. We performed a time-course analysis of histone modifications, chromatin remodelling enzymes and gene expression in the prefrontal cortex of female rats after adolescent and adult THC exposure. We also administered a specific epigenetic drug (chaetocin) with THC to investigate its impact on THC-induced behavioural alterations. RESULTS. Adolescent THC exposure induced alterations of selective histone modifications (mainly H3K9me3), impacting the expression of genes closely associated with synaptic plasticity. Changes in both histone modifications and gene expression were more widespread and intense after adolescent treatment, suggesting specific adolescent susceptibility. Adolescent THC exposure significantly increased Suv39H1 levels, which could account for the enhanced H3K9me3. Pharmacological blockade of H3K9me3 during adolescent THC treatment prevented THC-induced cognitive deficits, suggesting the relevant role played by H3K9me3 in THC-induced effects. CONCLUSIONS.

2119,[!] О”9-Tetrahydrocannabinol attenuates MDMA-induced hyperthermia in rhesus monkeys.,22138434,,2012,"BACKGROUND. Cannabis is commonly consumed by Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; MDMA) users, including as an intentional strategy to manipulate the drug experience. The most active psychoactive constituent in cannabis, О”(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and other drugs with partial or full agonist activity at the CB(1) receptor, produces a reduction of body temperature in rodents. Reports show that administration of THC can attenuate temperature increases caused by MDMA in mice or rats; however, a recent study in humans shows that THC potentiates MDMA-induced temperature elevations. Relatively little scientific evidence on the thermoregulatory effects of THC in monkeys is available. METHODS. The body temperature of male rhesus macaques was recorded after challenge with THC (0.1-0.3 mg/kg, i.m.) or combined challenge of THC with the CB(1) receptor antagonist SR141716 (Rimonabant; 0.3 mg/kg, i.m.) or combined challenge of THC (0.1, 0.3 mg/kg, i.m.) with MDMA (1.78 mg/kg p.o.) using minimally-invasive, implanted radiotelemetry techniques. RESULTS. THC reduced the body temperature of monkeys in a dose-dependent manner with the nadir observed 3-5 h post-injection; however, an attenuation of normal circadian cooling was also produced overnight following dosing. Hypothermia induced by THC (0.3 mg/kg, i.m.) was prevented by Rimonabant (0.3 mg/kg, i.m.). Finally, 0.3 mg/kg THC (i.m.) attenuated the elevation of body temperature produced by MDMA for about 4 h after oral dosing. CONCLUSIONS. As with rodents THC produces a robust and lasting decrement in the body temperature of rhesus monkeys; this effect is mediated by the CB(1) receptor.

Cannabis dependent participants (7 males and 7 females, who smoked on average 5.4 В± 1.1 blunts daily) completed 3 experimental sessions (oral THC pretreatment dose; counterbalanced order) using a placebo-controlled within-subject crossover design. During each session, participants completed a baseline evaluation and were first exposed to neutral cues then marijuana cues while physiological measures and subjective ratings of mood, craving, and drug effect were recorded. RESULTS. Following placebo oral THC pretreatment, marijuana (vs. neutral) cues significantly increased ratings of marijuana craving (desire and urge to use, Marijuana Craving Questionnaire (MCQ)-Compulsivity scale), anxious mood and feeling hungry. Males also reported feeling more ""Down"" during marijuana cues relative to females. Pretreatment with oral THC (10-mg and/or 20-mg vs. placebo) significantly attenuated marijuana cue-induced increases in craving and anxiety but not hunger. Oral THC attenuation of the cue-induced increase in MCQ-Compulsivity ratings was observed in females only. Oral THC produced statistically (but not clinically) significant increases in heart rate and decreases in diastolic blood pressure, independent of cues. CONCLUSIONS. These marijuana-cue findings replicate earlier results and further demonstrate that oral THC can attenuate selected effects during marijuana multi-cue exposure, and that some of these effects may be sex-related.

2256,[!] Critical Role of Mast Cells and Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Оі in the Induction of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells by Marijuana Cannabidiol In Vivo.,25917103,,2015,"Cannabidiol (CBD) is a natural nonpsychotropic cannabinoid from marijuana (Cannabis sativa) with anti-epileptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Effect of CBD on naive immune system is not precisely understood. In this study, we observed that administering CBD into naive mice triggers robust induction of CD11b(+)Gr-1(+) myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in the peritoneum, which expressed functional arginase 1, and potently suppressed T cell proliferation ex vivo. Furthermore, CBD-MDSC suppressed LPS-induced acute inflammatory response upon adoptive transfer in vivo. CBD-induced suppressor cells were comprised of CD11b(+)Ly6-G(+)Ly6-C(+) granulocytic and CD11b(+)Ly6-G(-)Ly6-C(+) monocytic subtypes, with monocytic MDSC exhibiting higher T cell-suppressive function. Induction of MDSC by CBD was markedly attenuated in Kit-mutant (Kit(W/W-v)) mast cell-deficient mice. MDSC response was reconstituted upon transfer of wild-type bone marrow-derived mast cells in Kit(W/W-v) mice, suggesting the key role of cKit (CD117) as well as mast cells. Moreover, mast cell activator compound 48/80 induced significant levels of MDSC in vivo. CBD administration in mice induced G-CSF, CXCL1, and M-CSF, but not GM-CSF. G-CSF was found to play a key role in MDSC mobilization inasmuch as neutralizing G-CSF caused a significant decrease in MDSC.

Cannabidiol (CBD) is a natural nonpsychotropic cannabinoid from marijuana (Cannabis sativa) with anti-epileptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Effect of CBD on naive immune system is not precisely understood. In this study, we observed that administering CBD into naive mice triggers robust induction of CD11b(+)Gr-1(+) myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in the peritoneum, which expressed functional arginase 1, and potently suppressed T cell proliferation ex vivo. Furthermore, CBD-MDSC suppressed LPS-induced acute inflammatory response upon adoptive transfer in vivo. CBD-induced suppressor cells were comprised of CD11b(+)Ly6-G(+)Ly6-C(+) granulocytic and CD11b(+)Ly6-G(-)Ly6-C(+) monocytic subtypes, with monocytic MDSC exhibiting higher T cell-suppressive function. Induction of MDSC by CBD was markedly attenuated in Kit-mutant (Kit(W/W-v)) mast cell-deficient mice. MDSC response was reconstituted upon transfer of wild-type bone marrow-derived mast cells in Kit(W/W-v) mice, suggesting the key role of cKit (CD117) as well as mast cells. Moreover, mast cell activator compound 48/80 induced significant levels of MDSC in vivo. CBD administration in mice induced G-CSF, CXCL1, and M-CSF, but not GM-CSF. G-CSF was found to play a key role in MDSC mobilization inasmuch as neutralizing G-CSF caused a significant decrease in MDSC. Lastly, CBD enhanced the transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Оі in luciferase reporter assay, and PPAR-Оі selective antagonist completely inhibited MDSC induction in vivo, suggesting its critical role. Together, the results suggest that CBD may induce activation of PPAR-Оі in mast cells leading to secretion of G-CSF and consequent MDSC mobilization.

2266,[!] Cannabis and caries--does regular cannabis use increase the risk of caries in cigarette smokers?.,20112637,,2009,"The use of cannabis by adolescents in Switzerland has almost doubled in the past decade. Empirical observations in private dental practices indicate that cannabis users have more carious lesions than those who do not use cannabis. The aim of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that regular cannabis use increases the risk of caries because of hyposalivation or lifestyle. Forty-three regular cannabis users were enrolled in the test group and 42 tobacco smokers were used as a negative control group. All subjects were 18-25 years old.

Results thus show that THC-induced apoptosis in glioma C6.9 cells may rely on a CBI receptor-independent stimulation of sphingomyelin breakdown."

Cannabinoid compounds are known to regulate feeding behavior by modulating the hedonic and/or the incentive properties of food. OBJECTIVE. The aim of this work was to determine the involvement of the cannabinoid system in food reinforcement associated with a conflict situation generated by stress. METHODS. Mice were trained on a fixed ratio 1 schedule of reinforcement to obtain standard, chocolate-flavored or fat-enriched pellets. Once the acquisition criteria were achieved, the reinforced lever press was paired with foot-shock exposure, and the effects of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; 1 mg/kg) were evaluated in this conflict paradigm. RESULTS. THC did not modify the operant response in mice trained with standard pellets. In contrast, THC improved the instrumental performance of mice trained with chocolate-flavored and fat-enriched pellets. However, the cannabinoid agonist did not fully restore the baseline responses obtained previous to foot-shock delivery. THC ameliorated the performance to obtain high palatable food in this conflict test in both food-restricted and sated mice. The effects of THC on food reinforcement seem to be long-lasting since mice previously treated with this compound showed a better recovery of the instrumental behavior after foot-shock exposure.

2337,[!] Cannabinoids reduce ErbB2-driven breast cancer progression through Akt inhibition.,20649976,,2010,"BACKGROUND. ErbB2-positive breast cancer is characterized by highly aggressive phenotypes and reduced responsiveness to standard therapies. Although specific ErbB2-targeted therapies have been designed, only a small percentage of patients respond to these treatments and most of them eventually relapse. The existence of this population of particularly aggressive and non-responding or relapsing patients urges the search for novel therapies. The purpose of this study was to determine whether cannabinoids might constitute a new therapeutic tool for the treatment of ErbB2-positive breast tumors. We analyzed their antitumor potential in a well established and clinically relevant model of ErbB2-driven metastatic breast cancer: the MMTV-neu mouse. We also analyzed the expression of cannabinoid targets in a series of 87 human breast tumors. RESULTS. Our results show that both Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the most abundant and potent cannabinoid in marijuana, and JWH-133, a non-psychotropic CB2 receptor-selective agonist, reduce tumor growth, tumor number, and the amount/severity of lung metastases in MMTV-neu mice. Histological analyses of the tumors revealed that cannabinoids inhibit cancer cell proliferation, induce cancer cell apoptosis, and impair tumor angiogenesis. Cannabinoid antitumoral action relies, at least partially, on the inhibition of the pro-tumorigenic Akt pathway.

By analyzing the gene expression profile of two sub-clones of C6 glioma cells with different sensitivity to cannabinoid-induced apoptosis, we found a subset of genes with a marked differential expression in the two sub-clones. Furthermore, we identified the epidermal growth factor receptor ligand amphiregulin as a candidate factor to mediate the resistance of glioma cells to cannabinoid treatment. Amphiregulin was highly overexpressed in the cannabinoid-resistant cell line, both in culture and in tumor xenografts. Moreover, in vivo silencing of amphiregulin rendered the resistant tumors xenografts sensitive to cannabinoid antitumoral action. Amphiregulin expression was associated with increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, which mediated the resistance to THC by blunting the expression of p8 and TRB3-two genes involved in cannabinoid-induced apoptosis of glioma cells. Our findings therefore identify Amphirregulin as a factor for resistance of glioma cells to THC-induced apoptosis and contribute to unraveling the molecular bases underlying the emerging notion that targeted inhibition of the EGFR pathway can improve the efficacy of antitumoral therapies.",Glia,,glioma,,THC,,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Compound: THC; Indication: glioma,"Title: [!] Amphiregulin is a factor for resistance of glioma cells to cannabinoid-induced apoptosis.

Air pollutants prompt and promote chronic inflammation, tumourigenesis, autoimmune and other destructive processes in the human body. Post-translational modification of proteins, for example citrullination, results from damaging attacks of pollutants, including smoking, air pollution and others, rendering host tissues immunogenic. Citrullinated proteins and citrullinating enzymes, deiminases, are more prevalent in patients with COPD and correlate with ongoing inflammation and oxidative stress. In this study, we installed an in-house-designed diesel exhaust delivery and cannabidiol vaporization system where mice were exposed to relevant, urban traffic-related levels of diesel exhaust for 14В days and assessed integrity of alveolar tissue, gene expression shifts and changes in protein content in the lungs and other tissues of exposed mice. Systemic presence of modified proteins was also tested. The protective effect of phytocannabinoids was investigated as well. Data obtained in our study show subacute effects of diesel exhaust on mouse lung integrity and protein content. Emphysematous changes are documented in exposed mouse lungs. In parallel, increased levels of citrulline were detected in the alveolar lung tissue and peripheral blood of exposed mice. Pre-treatment with vaporized cannabidiol ameliorated some damaging effects.

2414,[!] Abnormal Cannabidiol Modulates Vitamin A Metabolism by Acting as a Competitive Inhibitor of CRBP1.,30721022,,2019,"Cellular retinol-binding proteins (CRBPs) facilitate the uptake and intracellular transport of vitamin A. They integrate retinoid metabolism, playing an important role in regulating the synthesis of bioactive vitamin A metabolites. Thus, CRBPs constitute potential pharmacological targets to modulate cellular retinoid status that in turn may have applications in the treatment of certain immunological, metabolic, and ocular disorders. Here we identify abnormal cannabidiol (abn-CBD) as a nonretinoid inhibitor of cellular retinol-binding protein 1 (CRBP1). X-ray crystal structures of CRBP1 in complex with abn-CBD and its derivatives revealed a distinctive mode of protein-ligand interaction and provided a molecular basis for the high affinity and selectivity of this compound. We demonstrated that abn-CBD modulates the flux of retinoids via the retinoid cycle in vivo. Furthermore, the biological activity of abn-CBD was evidenced by its ability to protect against light-induced retinal damage in Balb/cJ mice. Altogether, our findings indicate that targeting selected CRBPs with a small-molecule inhibitor can potentially lead to the development of new therapeutic agents to counteract diseases with etiologies involving imbalance in retinoid metabolism or signaling.",ACS chemical biology,,retinal damage,,CBD,,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Compound: CBD; Indication: retinal damage,"Title: [!] Abnormal Cannabidiol Modulates Vitamin A Metabolism by Acting as a Competitive Inhibitor of CRBP1.

The Japan-China Joint Medical Workshop on Drug Discoveries and Therapeutics 2008 (JCMWDDT 2008) was held from September 29 to October 1, 2008 at The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. JCMWDDT is an international workshop that is mainly organized by Asian editorial members of Drug Discoveries & Therapeutics (http://www.ddtjournal.com/home) for the purpose of promoting research exchanges in the field of drug discovery and therapeutic. This year's JCMWDDT is the second workshop and focused particularly on novel development and technological innovation of anti-influenza agents. The workshop began with an announcement by the Japanese Co-chairperson, Dr. Sekimizu (Department of Microbiology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Japan; Editorin- Chief of Drug Discoveries & Therapeutics, DDT) followed by a speech by the Chinese Co-chairperson, Dr. Wenfang Xu (School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, Shandong, China; Editor in China Office of DDT), with additional speeches by Dr. Norio Matsuki (The University of Tokyo, Japan; Editor of DDT) and Dr. Guanhua Du (Chinese Academy of Medical Science, China; Editor of DDT). Fifty-nine titles were presented in 6 specialized sessions (Research Advances in Drug Discoveries and Therapeutics, Drug Synthesis/Clinical Therapeutics, Medicinal Chemistry/Natural Products, Anti-influenza Drugs, Anti-infection/antiviral Drugs, Biochemistry/Molecular Biology /Pharmacology) and a poster session (Drug Discov Ther 2008; 2, Suppl; available at http://www.ddtjournal.com/Announce/index.htm). An annual outbreak of avian influenza in Asian countries including China and Japan has sparked fears that the virus will mutate and then cause an epidemic in humans. Therefore, Asian researchers need to work together to control this infection. This year's JCMWDDT helped provide an opportunity to reiterate the crucial role of medicinal chemistry in conquering influenza and created an environment for cooperative research in Asian countries.

The treatment of stem cells as a therapeutic approach to repair damage in the central nervous system represents a valid alternative. In this study, using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology, we analyzed the transcriptomic profile of human Gingival Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hGMSCs) treated with Moringin [4-(О±-l-ramanosyloxy)-benzyl isothiocyanate] (hGMSCs-MOR) or with Cannabidiol (hGMSCs-CBD) at dose of 0.5 or 5 ВµM, respectively. Moreover, we compared their transcriptomic profiles in order to evaluate analogies and differences in pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways. The hGMSCs-MOR selectively downregulate TNF-О± signaling from the beginning, reducing the expression of TNF-О± receptor while hGMSCs-CBD limit its activity after the process started. The treatment with CBD downregulates the pro-inflammatory pathway mediated by the IL-1 family, including its receptor while MOR is less efficient. Furthermore, both the treatments are efficient in the IL-6 signaling. In particular, CBD reduces the effect of the pro-inflammatory JAK/STAT pathway while MOR enhances the pro-survival PI3K/AKT/mTOR.

However, evidence of its effectiveness is scarce and focuses primarily on the effectiveness of the oil in reducing epileptic seizures. Known side-effects are vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, sleepiness, and abnormal liver function test results. We advise medical professionals who encounter young patients who may potentially be using CBD oil, to discuss its questionable quality and potential side effects and interactions. If a patient presents with poorly-understood fever, diarrhoea, vomiting or drowsiness, then the side effects of CBD oil should be considered. Finally, CBD should be differentiated from delta-THC, a cannabis-derived chemical with a psychoactive effect, the use of which should be discouraged in children."

This study evaluated the potential of combined cannabis constituents to reduce nausea. OBJECTIVE. Using the lithium chloride (LiCl)-induced conditioned gaping model of nausea in male rats, we aimed to: 1) Determine effective anti-nausea doses of cannabidiol (CBD) 2) Determine effectiveness and the mechanism of action of combined subthreshold doses of CBD and О”-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 3) Determine effective doses of synthetic cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) 4) Determine effective doses of synthetic tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) 5) Determine the mechanism of action for THCA 6) Determine effectiveness and the mechanism of action of combined subthreshold doses of CBDA and THCA RESULTS: CBD (0.5-5В mg/kg, intraperitoneal [i.p.]) reduces LiCl-induced conditioned gaping (but 0.1, 20, 40В mg/kg are ineffective). Combined subthreshold doses of CBD (0.1В mg/kg, i.p.) and THC (0.1В mg/kg, i.p.) produce suppression of conditioned gaping, and this effect is blocked by administration of either WAY100635 (a serotonin 1A [5-HT-1A]) receptor antagonist or SR141716 (SR; a CB-1 receptor antagonist).

All tissues were homogenized in 5% TCA/EDTA solution and supernatant solutions of these homogenates were diluted. In these diluted samples, levels of GSH were determined by a modified spectrophotometric procedure and the GSH levels were expressed as micromoles of GSH/g tissue. In this study, THC caused no effects on GSH levels in brain, heart, testis and plasma. However, GSH levels in liver and kidney were decreased by 14% and 7% respectively.

2496,[!] Cannabinoid withdrawal in mice: inverse agonist vs neutral antagonist.,25772338,,2015,"BACKGROUND. Previous reports shows rimonabant's inverse properties may be a limiting factor for treating cannabinoid dependence. To overcome this limitation, neutral antagonists were developed, to address mechanisms by which an inverse agonist and neutral antagonist elicit withdrawal. OBJECTIVE. The objective of this study is to introduce an animal model to study cannabinoid dependence by incorporating traditional methodologies and profiling novel cannabinoid ligands with distinct pharmacological properties/modes of action by evaluating their pharmacological effects on CB1-receptor (CB1R) related physiological/behavioral endpoints. METHODS. The cannabinergic AM2389 was acutely characterized in the tetrad (locomotor activity, analgesia, inverted screen/catalepsy bar test, and temperature), with some comparisons made to О”(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Tolerance was measured in mice repeatedly administered AM2389. Antagonist-precipitated withdrawal was characterized in cannabinoid-adapted mice induced by either centrally acting antagonists, rimonabant and AM4113, or an antagonist with limited brain penetration, AM6545. RESULTS. In the tetrad, AM2389 was more potent and longer acting than THC, suggesting a novel approach for inducing dependence. Repeated administration of AM2389 led to tolerance by attenuating hypothermia that was induced by acute AM2389 administration. Antagonist-precipitated withdrawal signs were induced by rimonabant or AM4113, but not by AM6545. Antagonist-precipitated withdrawal was reversed by reinstating AM2389 or THC. CONCLUSIONS. These findings suggest cannabinoid-precipitated withdrawal may not be ascribed to the inverse properties of rimonabant, but rather to rapid competition with the agonist at the CB1R. This withdrawal syndrome is likely centrally mediated, since only the centrally acting CB1R antagonists elicited withdrawal, i.e., such responses were absent after the purported peripherally selective CB1R antagonist AM6545.",Psychopharmacology,,hypothermia,,THC,,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Compound: THC; Indication: hypothermia,"Title: [!] Cannabinoid withdrawal in mice: inverse agonist vs neutral antagonist.

Here we show that CT-3 binds to human cannabinoid receptors in vitro, with high affinity at hCB1 (Ki 6 nM) and hCB2 (Ki 56 nM) receptors. In a functional GTP-gamma-S assay CT-3 was an agonist at both hCB1 and hCB2 receptors (EC50 11 and 13.4 nM, respectively). In behavioural models of chronic neuropathic and inflammatory pain in the rat, oral administration of CT-3 (0.1-1 mg/kg) produced up to 60% reversal of mechanical hyperalgesia. In both models the antihyperalgesic activity was prevented by the CB1-antagonist SR141716A but not the CB2-antagonist SR144528. In the tetrad of tests for CNS activity, CT-3 (1-10 mg/kg, po) produced dose-related catalepsy, deficits in locomotor performance, hypothermia, and acute analgesia. Comparison of 50% maximal effects in the tetrad and chronic pain assays produced an approximate therapeutic index of 5-10.

These data show that CT-3 is a cannabinoid receptor agonist and is efficacious in animal models of chronic pain by activation of the CB1 receptor.

Compared with adults, it appears that adolescents with EVALI more frequently have a history of asthma and mental, emotional, or behavioral disorders, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and report nonspecific problems, including gastrointestinal and constitutional symptoms; therefore, obtaining a confidential substance use history that includes e-cigarette or vaping product use is recommended."

Macrophages pretreated with THC at 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 micrograms/ml in protein-free medium for 3 h at 37 degrees C, prior to TNF induction, also showed a decreased ability to produce TNF-alpha in a dose-dependent manner. Increasing the protein concentration from 0.5 to 5% BSA in the medium which was used to induce TNF prevented the inhibitory activity of THC. Human peripheral blood adherent cells treated with THC-containing medium produced less TNF-alpha than controls that were not exposed to THC. Thus, our data provide evidence that THC can inhibit TNF production by mouse and human macrophages. The drug's activity is concentration dependent and is related to the amount of serum protein in the medium used to induce this cytokine."

It was shown that this irritable aggression could be measured continuously and quantitatively in terms of degree of activity and/or vocalization using a newly designed analyzer. The effect of THC differed markedly from the action of apomorphine and methamphetamine in 6-OHDA pretreated rats. Apomorphine induced irritable aggression but not vigorous vocalization. On the other hand, methamphetamine induced much less irritable aggression than apomorphine-induced aggression. It is assumed that a THC-invoked imbalance in catecholamine agonistic and serotonin antagonistic action brought about by activation of supersensitized catecholaminergic receptor was operating to produce the aggression.

Chronic neuropathic pain affects 1%-2% of the adult population and is often refractory to standard pharmacologic treatment. Patients with chronic pain have reported using smoked cannabis to relieve pain, improve sleep and improve mood. METHODS. Adults with post-traumatic or postsurgical neuropathic pain were randomly assigned to receive cannabis at four potencies (0%, 2.5%, 6% and 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol) over four 14-day periods in a crossover trial. Participants inhaled a single 25-mg dose through a pipe three times daily for the first five days in each cycle, followed by a nine-day washout period. Daily average pain intensity was measured using an 11-point numeric rating scale. We recorded effects on mood, sleep and quality of life, as well as adverse events. RESULTS. We recruited 23 participants (mean age 45.4 [standard deviation 12.3] years, 12 women [52%]), of whom 21 completed the trial. The average daily pain intensity, measured on the 11-point numeric rating scale, was lower on the prespecified primary contrast of 9.4% v. 0% tetrahydrocannabinol (5.4 v. 6.1, respectively; difference = 0.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02-1.4).

Cannabinoid-induced analgesia was shown in animal studies of acute inflammatory and neuropathic pain. In humans, controlled clinical trials with Delta-tetrahydrocannabinol or other cannabinoids demonstrated analgesic efficacy in chronic pain syndromes, whereas the data in acute pain were less conclusive. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of oral cannabis extract in two different human models of acute inflammatory pain and hyperalgesia. METHODS. The authors conducted a double-blind, crossover study in 18 healthy female volunteers. Capsules containing Delta-tetrahydrocannabinol-standardized cannabis extract or active placebo were orally administered. A circular sunburn spot was induced at one upper leg. Heat and electrical pain thresholds were determined at the erythema, the area of secondary hyperalgesia, and the contralateral leg. Intradermal capsaicin-evoked pain and areas of flare and secondary hyperalgesia were measured. Primary outcome parameters were heat pain thresholds in the sunburn erythema and the capsaicin-evoked area of secondary hyperalgesia. Secondary measures were electrical pain thresholds, sunburn-induced secondary hyperalgesia, and capsaicin-induced pain. RESULTS. Cannabis extract did not affect heat pain thresholds in the sunburn model. Electrical thresholds (250 Hz) were significantly lower compared with baseline and placebo. In the capsaicin model, the area of secondary hyperalgesia, flare, and spontaneous pain were not altered. CONCLUSIONS.

Despite improvements in medical care, patients with advanced cancer still experience substantial symptom distress. There is increasing interest in the use of medicinal cannabinoids but little high-quality evidence to guide clinicians. This study aims to define the role of a 1:1 delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol (THC/CBD) cannabinoid preparation in the management of symptom burden in patients with advanced cancer undergoing standard palliative care. METHODS. One hundred fifty participants will be recruited from five sites within the Queensland Palliative Care Research Group (QPCRG) and randomly assigned to an active treatment or placebo group. This study is a pragmatic multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, two-arm trial of escalating doses of an oral 1:1 THC/CBD cannabinoid preparation. It will compare efficacy and safety outcomes of a titrated dose (10вЂ‰mg/10вЂ‰mg/mL oral solution formulation, dose range 2.5вЂ‰mg/2.5вЂ‰mg-30вЂ‰mg/30вЂ‰mg/day) against placebo. There is a 2-week patient-determined titration phase, using escalating doses of 1:1 THC/CBD or placebo, to reach a dose that achieves symptom relief with tolerable side effects. This is then followed by a further 2-week assessment period on the stable dose determined in collaboration with clinicians. The primary objective is to assess the effect of escalating doses of a 1:1 THC/CBD cannabinoid preparation against placebo on change in total symptom score, with secondary objectives including establishing a patient-determined effective dose, the change in total physical and emotional sores, global impression of change, anxiety and depression, opioid use, quality of life and adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS. This will be the first placebo-controlled clinical trial to rigorously evaluate the efficacy, safety and acceptability of 1:1 THC/CBD for symptom relief in advanced cancer patients.

In Parkinson's disease patients, CBD is able to attenuate the psychotic symptoms induced by L-DOPA and to improve quality of life. Repeated administration of reserpine in rodents induces motor impairments that are accompanied by cognitive deficits, and has been applied to model both tardive dyskinesia and Parkinson's disease. The present study investigated whether CBD administration would attenuate reserpine-induced motor and cognitive impairments in rats. Male Wistar rats received four injections of CBD (0.5 or 5 mg/kg) or vehicle (days 2-5). On days 3 and 5, animals received also one injection of 1 mg/kg reserpine or vehicle. Locomotor activity, vacuous chewing movements, and catalepsy were assessed from day 1 to day 7. On days 8 and 9, we evaluated animals' performance on the plus-maze discriminative avoidance task, for learning/memory assessment.

Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychotomimetic compound from Cannabis sativa that presents antipsychotic, anxiolytic, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. In Parkinson's disease patients, CBD is able to attenuate the psychotic symptoms induced by L-DOPA and to improve quality of life. Repeated administration of reserpine in rodents induces motor impairments that are accompanied by cognitive deficits, and has been applied to model both tardive dyskinesia and Parkinson's disease. The present study investigated whether CBD administration would attenuate reserpine-induced motor and cognitive impairments in rats. Male Wistar rats received four injections of CBD (0.5 or 5 mg/kg) or vehicle (days 2-5). On days 3 and 5, animals received also one injection of 1 mg/kg reserpine or vehicle.

The purported neurocognitive effects of early cannabis onset may not be due to cannabis initiation alone but also driven by limitations or late development of neurocognitive systems predictive of substance use. In addition, more prolonged cannabis exposure may be required to observe the cognitive effects of early cannabis onset."
2990,[!] Mapping cannabis potency in medical and recreational programs in the United States.,32214334,,2020,"Cannabis related online searches are associated with positive attitudes toward medical cannabis, particularly when information is obtained from dispensaries. Since pain is the main reason for medicinal cannabis use, information from dispensary websites has the potential to shape the attitude of pain patients towards cannabis. This is relevant because cannabis has demonstrated efficacy in neuropathic pain with low tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentrations (< 5-10%), in contrast to potent cannabis (>15% THC), which is highly rewarded in the recreational realm. The role of CBD in pain is not clear, however it has gained popularity. Thus, we hypothesize that the potency of medical cannabis that is advertised online is similar to the cannabis advertised for recreational purposes, which would potentially create a misconception towards medical cannabis. The current lack of knowledge surrounding advertised potencies in the legal cannabis market limits the ability to generate clear policies regarding online advertising to protect patients that are willing to use cannabis for their condition. Thus, we evaluated the advertised THC and CBD content of cannabis products offered online in dispensaries in the United States to determine products' suitability to medicinal use and compare the strength of products offered in legal medical and recreational programs. We recorded THC and CBD concentrations for all herb cannabis products provided by dispensary websites and compared them between or within states. Four Western states (CA, CO, NM, WA) and five Northeastern states (ME, MA, NH, RI, VT) were included. A total of 8,505 cannabis products across 653 dispensaries were sampled. Despite the clear differences between medicinal and recreational uses of cannabis, the average THC concentration advertised online in medicinal programs was similar (19.2% В±6.2) to recreational programs (21.5% В±6.0) when compared between states with different programs, or between medicinal and recreational programs within the same states (CO or WA). Lower CBD concentrations accompanied higher THC products. The majority of products, regardless of medicinal or recreational programs, were advertised to have >15% THC (70.3% 91.4% of products). These stated concentrations seem unsuitable for medicinal purposes, particularly for patients with chronic neuropathic pain. Therefore, this information could induce the misconception that high potency cannabis is safe to treat pain.

Cardiovascular complications are the major cause of mortality in diabetic patients. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying diabetes-associated arrhythmias are unclear. We hypothesized that high glucose could adversely affect Na-v 1.5, the major cardiac sodium channel isoform of the heart, at least partially via oxidative stress. We further hypothesized that cannabidiol (CBD), one of the main constituents of Cannabis sativa, through its effects on Na-v 1.5, could protect against high glucose-elicited oxidative stress and cytotoxicity. METHODS. To test these ideas, we used CHO cells transiently co-transfected with cDNA encoding human Na-v 1.5 О±-subunit under control and high glucose conditions (50 or 100 mM for 24 hr). Several experimental and computational techniques were used, including voltage clamp of heterologous expression systems, cell viability assays, fluorescence assays and action potential modelling. RESULTS. High glucose evoked cell death associated with elevation in reactive oxygen species (ROS) right shifted the voltage dependence of conductance and steady-state fast inactivation, and increased persistent current leading to computational prolongation of action potential (hyperexcitability) which could result in long QT3 arrhythmia. CBD mitigated all the deleterious effects provoked by high glucose.

An organotypic brain slice culture model was used for safety and toxicity studies. A human glioma-SCID mouse side-pocket tumor model was used to test in vivo the safety and efficacy of KM-233 with intratumoral and intra-peritoneal administration. RESULTS. KM-233 is a classical cannabinoid with good blood brain barrier penetration that possesses a selective affinity for the CB2 receptors relative to THC. KM-233 was as efficacious in its cytotoxicity against human U87 glioma as Delta(8)-tetrahydrocannabinol, and superior to the commonly used anti-glioma chemotherapeutic agent, BCNU.

Unified theories of addiction are challenged by differing drug-seeking behaviors and neurobiological adaptations across drug classes, particularly for narcotics and psychostimulants. We previously showed that protracted abstinence to opiates leads to despair behavior and social withdrawal in mice, and we identified a transcriptional signature in the extended amygdala that was also present in animals abstinent from nicotine, О”9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and alcohol. Here we examined whether protracted abstinence to these four drugs would also share common behavioral features, and eventually differ from abstinence to the prototypic psychostimulant cocaine.

Here we report the phase II component results. METHODS. Eligible patients experienced CINV during moderate-to-high emetogenic intravenous chemotherapy despite guideline-consistent antiemetic prophylaxis. Study treatment consisted of one cycle of 1-4 self-titrated capsules of oral THC 2.5 mg/CBD 2.5 mg (TN-TC11M) three times daily, from daysВ -1 to 5, and 1 cycle of matching placebo in a crossover design, then blinded patient preference for a third cycle.

Here, we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a naturally occurring cannabinoid, on brain activity related to cutaneous ongoing pain and hyperalgesia that were temporarily induced by capsaicin in healthy volunteers. On average, THC reduced the reported unpleasantness, but not the intensity of ongoing pain and hyperalgesia: the specific analgesic effect on hyperalgesia was substantiated by diminished activity in the anterior mid cingulate cortex. In individuals, the drug-induced reduction in the unpleasantness of hyperalgesia was positively correlated with right amygdala activity. THC also reduced functional connectivity between the amygdala and primary sensorimotor areas during the ongoing-pain state.

However, it is not well known how cannabinoids influence the effects of chemotherapeutic agents on malignant tumors. In this study, we investigated how the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide (AEA) changes the effect of paclitaxel on gastric cancer cell lines. In the human gastric cancer cell line, HGC-27, which express cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), AEA stimulated proliferation at concentrations under 1 microM, while it strongly suppressed proliferation through the induction of apoptosis at 10 microM. This bimodal effect was reproduced by a selective CB1 agonist, arachidonyl-2-chloroethylamide, although the effects were less marked. When AEA was used with paclitaxel, AEA at 10 microM synergistically enhanced the cytotoxic effect of paclitaxel, whereas it showed no significant effect at lower concentrations. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that addition of 10 microM AEA synergistically enhanced paclitaxel-induced apoptosis, possibly through the activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9.

Direct measurements were made of spontaneously firing, epileptic potentials from a primary focus on the parietal cortex and convulsions were monitored visually.

Relative to vehicle-exposed animals, repeated THC exposure was initially associated with significantly slower improvement in performance accuracy on 4-item spatial WM trials; however, this performance difference gradually diminished such that by month 12, accuracy did not significantly differ between vehicle and THC groups. Similarly, for the novel and distractor 8-item trials introduced at month 6, performance accuracy improved more slowly in the THC than in the vehicle group, despite comparable performance between groups on the 4-item task during this same period.

Performance on 4-item spatial WM trials was assessed throughout the 12-month study period. At the 6-month time point, more difficult novel and distractor 8-item spatial WM trials were added. Residual effects on performance were determined 23 or 71вЂ‰h after THC or vehicle administration throughout the study. Relative to vehicle-exposed animals, repeated THC exposure was initially associated with significantly slower improvement in performance accuracy on 4-item spatial WM trials; however, this performance difference gradually diminished such that by month 12, accuracy did not significantly differ between vehicle and THC groups. Similarly, for the novel and distractor 8-item trials introduced at month 6, performance accuracy improved more slowly in the THC than in the vehicle group, despite comparable performance between groups on the 4-item task during this same period. These findings suggest that compared to vehicle exposure, THC exposure during adolescence impairs the reinforcement-related learning process required for improved performance on spatial WM tasks, but this impairment might be overcome with continued training, even in the face of ongoing THC exposure."

We thus conducted a study with three main goals: (1) quantify the effect of THC on visual working memory in a well-powered sample, (2) test the potential role of cognitive effects (mind wandering and metacognition) in disrupting working memory, and (3) demonstrate how insufficient sample size and task duration reduce the likelihood of detecting a drug effect. We conducted two double-blind, randomized crossover experiments in which healthy adults (NвЂ‰=вЂ‰23, 23) performed a reliable and validated visual working memory task (the ""Discrete Whole Report task"", 90 trials) after administration of THC (7.5 and/or 15вЂ‰mg oral) or placebo. We also assessed self-reported ""mind wandering"" (Exp 1) and metacognitive accuracy about ongoing task performance (Exp 2). THC impaired working memory performance (dвЂ‰=вЂ‰0.65), increased mind wandering (Exp 1), and decreased metacognitive accuracy about task performance (Exp 2). Thus, our findings indicate that THC does impair visual working memory, and that this impairment may be related to both increased mind wandering and decreased monitoring of task performance. Finally, we used a down-sampling procedure to illustrate the effects of task length and sample size on power to detect the acute effect of THC on working memory."

Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1 ) antagonists show central side effects, whereas beneficial effects are most likely peripherally mediated. In this study, the peripherally selective CB1 antagonist TM38837 was studied in humans. METHODS. This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study. On occasions 1-4, 24 healthy subjects received 5 Г— 4 mg THC with TM38837 100 mg, 500 mg or placebo, or placebos only. During occasion 5, subjects received placebo TM38837 + THC with rimonabant 60 mg or placebo in parallel groups. Blood collections and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects were assessed frequently. Pharmacokinetics (PK) and PD were quantified using population PK-PD modelling. RESULTS. The TM38837 plasma concentration profile was relatively flat compared with rimonabant. TM38837 showed an estimated terminal half-life of 771 h. THC induced effects on VAS feeling high, body sway and heart rate were partly antagonized by rimonabant 60 mg [-26.70% [90% confidence interval (CI) -40.9, -12.6%]; -7.10%, (90%CI -18.1, 5.3%); -7.30%, (90% CI -11.5%, -3.0%) respectively] and TM38837 500 mg [-22.10% (90% CI -34.9, -9.4%); -12.20% (90% CI -21.6%, -1.7%); -8.90% (90% CI -12.8%, -5.1%) respectively]. TM38837 100 mg had no measurable feeling high or body sway effects and limited heart rate effects. CONCLUSIONS. Rimonabant showed larger effects than TM38837, but the heart rate effects were similar.

3335,[!] An open-label extension study to investigate the long-term safety and tolerability of THC/CBD oromucosal spray and oromucosal THC spray in patients with terminal cancer-related pain refractory to strong opioid analgesics.,23141881,Cancer; THC/CBD oromucosal spray; cannabinoid; delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol; pain,2013,"BACKGROUND. Chronic pain in patients with advanced cancer poses a serious clinical challenge. The О”9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)/cannabidiol (CBD) oromucosal spray (U.S. Adopted Name, nabiximols; Sativex(В®)) is a novel cannabinoid formulation currently undergoing investigation as an adjuvant therapy for this treatment group. OBJECTIVE. This follow-up study investigated the long-term safety and tolerability of THC/CBD spray and THC spray in relieving pain in patients with advanced cancer. METHODS. In total, 43 patients with cancer-related pain experiencing inadequate analgesia despite chronic opioid dosing, who had participated in a previous three-arm (THC/CBD spray, THC spray, or placebo), two-week parent randomized controlled trial, entered this open-label, multicenter, follow-up study. Patients self-titrated THC/CBD spray (n=39) or THC spray (n=4) to symptom relief or maximum dose and were regularly reviewed for safety, tolerability, and evidence of clinical benefit. RESULTS. The efficacy end point of change from baseline in mean Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form scores for ""pain severity"" and ""worst pain"" domains showed a decrease (i.e., improvement) at each visit in the THC/CBD spray patients.

3356,[!] Emergency Department and Radiological Cost of Delayed Diagnosis of Cannabinoid Hyperemesis.,30723570,,2019,"Background. Chronic cannabis use has become prevalent with decriminalization, medical prescription, and recreational legalization in numerous US states. With this increasing incidence of chronic cannabis use a new clinical syndrome has become apparent in emergency departments and hospitals across the country, termed Cannabinoid Hyperemesis (CH). CH has been described as cyclical vomiting and abdominal pain in the setting of chronic cannabis use, which is often temporarily relieved by hot showers. CH presents a diagnostic challenge to clinicians who do not have a high clinical suspicion for the syndrome and can result in high costs and resource utilization for hospitals and patients. This study investigates the expenditures associated with delayed CH evaluation and delayed diagnosis. Methods. This is a retrospective observational study of 17 patients diagnosed with CH at three medical centers in the United States from 2010 to 2015, consisting of two academic centers and a community hospital. Emergency department (ED) costs were calculated and analyzed for patients eventually diagnosed with CH. Results.

3371,[!] Treatment of cannabis dependence using escitalopram in combination with cognitive-behavior therapy: a double-blind placebo-controlled study.,24359507,,2014,"BACKGROUND. Cannabis is the most frequently used illegal substance in the United States and Europe. There is a dramatic increase in the demand for treatment for cannabis dependence. Cannabis users frequently have co-morbid mood symptoms, especially depression and anxiety, and regular cannabis users may self-medicate for such symptoms. OBJECTIVE. We report a double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment study, for the prevention of cannabis use in cannabis-dependent individuals. METHODS. Regular cannabis-dependent users (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰52) were treated for 9 weeks with weekly cognitive-behavior and motivation-enhancement therapy sessions together with escitalopram 10вЂ‰mg/day. Urine samples were collected to monitor delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) during treatment and questionnaires were administered to assess anxiety and depression. RESULTS. We observed a high rate of dropout (50%) during the 9-week treatment program. Fifty-two patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Of these, ten (19%) remained abstinent after 9 weeks of treatment as indicated by negative urine samples for THC. Escitalopram provided no advantage over placebo in either abstinence rates from cannabis or anxiety and depression scores during the withdrawal and abstinent periods. CONCLUSIONS. Escitalopram treatment does not provide an additional benefit either for achieving abstinence, or for the treatment of the cannabis withdrawal syndrome.

Spasticity is often assessed with subjective and clinical rating scales, which are unable to measure the increased excitability of the monosynaptic reflex, considered the hallmark of spasticity. The neurophysiological assessment of the stretch reflex provides a precise and objective method to measure spasticity. We propose a novel study to understand if Sativex could be useful in reducing spasticity in stroke survivors and investigating tolerability and safety by accurate cardiovascular monitoring.

Male Wistar rats were repeatedly exposed to Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC, 5 mg/kg i.p.) in a place-conditioning paradigm during either the adolescent (post-natal day 28+) or adult (post-natal day 60+) developmental stages. Adult rats avoided a Delta(9)-THC-paired environment after either four or eight pairings and this avoidance persisted for at least 16 days following the final Delta(9)-THC injection. In contrast, adolescent rats showed no significant place aversion. Adult Delta(9)-THC-treated rats produced more vocalizations than adolescent rats when handled during the intoxicated state, also suggesting greater drug-induced aversion. After a 10-15 day washout, both adult and adolescent Delta(9)-THC pretreated rats showed decreased social interaction, while only Delta(9)-THC pretreated adolescent rats showed significantly impaired object recognition memory. Seventeen days following their last Delta(9)-THC injection, rats were euthanased and hippocampal tissue processed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis proteomics. There was no evidence of residual Delta(9)-THC being present in blood at this time. Proteomic analysis uncovered 27 proteins, many involved in regulating oxidative stress/mitochondrial functioning and cytoarchitecture, which were differentially expressed in adolescent Delta(9)-THC pretreated rats relative to adolescent controls. In adults, only 10 hippocampal proteins were differentially expressed in Delta(9)-THC compared to vehicle-pretreated controls.

Adult rats avoided a Delta(9)-THC-paired environment after either four or eight pairings and this avoidance persisted for at least 16 days following the final Delta(9)-THC injection. In contrast, adolescent rats showed no significant place aversion. Adult Delta(9)-THC-treated rats produced more vocalizations than adolescent rats when handled during the intoxicated state, also suggesting greater drug-induced aversion. After a 10-15 day washout, both adult and adolescent Delta(9)-THC pretreated rats showed decreased social interaction, while only Delta(9)-THC pretreated adolescent rats showed significantly impaired object recognition memory. Seventeen days following their last Delta(9)-THC injection, rats were euthanased and hippocampal tissue processed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis proteomics. There was no evidence of residual Delta(9)-THC being present in blood at this time. Proteomic analysis uncovered 27 proteins, many involved in regulating oxidative stress/mitochondrial functioning and cytoarchitecture, which were differentially expressed in adolescent Delta(9)-THC pretreated rats relative to adolescent controls. In adults, only 10 hippocampal proteins were differentially expressed in Delta(9)-THC compared to vehicle-pretreated controls. Overall these findings suggest that adolescent rats find repeated Delta(9)-THC exposure less aversive than adults, but that cannabinoid exposure causes greater lasting memory deficits and hippocampal alterations in adolescent than adult rats."
3429,[!] Sex-dependent effects of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol on locomotor activity in mice.,14625027,,2003,"Sex differences in the effects of several drugs of abuse have previously been demonstrated. The present study evaluated sex differences in the effects of acute and repeated dosing with Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol on locomotor activity in male and female Swiss Webster (CFW) mice. Results showed that acute Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannibol (1-30 mg/kg) increased locomotor activity in female, but not in male, mice. Following 3 days of daily injections of 10 mg/kg Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, re-tests of the same doses of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol tested acutely showed that female mice continued to exhibit greater sensitivity to the stimulatory effects of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol than did male mice; however, higher doses were required to produce these increases, suggesting a modest degree of tolerance development.

3436,[!] Oral delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol improved refractory Gilles de la Tourette syndrome in an adolescent by increasing intracortical inhibition: a case report.,20520294,,2010,"OBJECTIVE. To describe the clinical course of the Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta 9-THC) treatment of a boy with Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome (TS) and comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in relation to Delta 9-THC plasma levels and intracortical inhibition measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation. METHODS. The clinical course and pharmacological and neurophysiological measures are reported in a 15-year-old boy with treatment refractory TS plus ADHD leading to severe physical and psychosocial impairment. RESULTS. Administration of Delta 9-THC improved tics considerably without adverse effects, allowing parallel stimulant treatment of comorbid ADHD. Along with the Delta 9-THC treatment, intracortical inhibition was increased, reflected in the enhanced short-interval intracortical inhibition and the prolongation of the cortical silent period. CONCLUSIONS. Our observation suggests that Delta 9-THC might be a successful alternative in patients with severe TS refractory to classic treatment. Particularly in the case of stimulant-induced exacerbation of tics, Delta 9-THC might enable successful treatment of comorbid ADHD. The enhancement of intracortical inhibition might be mediated by modulating release of several neurotransmitters including dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid.

3451,[!] The synthetic cannabinoid withdrawal syndrome.,23609214,,2013,"BACKGROUND. Little is known about the effects of synthetic cannabinoids. There has been only one previous report of a withdrawal syndrome from synthetic cannabinoids. We report two cases of a withdrawal syndrome from prolonged habitual use of synthetic cannabinoids. CONCLUSIONS. Withdrawal from delta-9-THC has been described as a syndrome of anxiety, myalgias, chills, and anorexia. Synthetic cannabinoids are potent than delta-9-THC and thus the withdrawal syndrome is similar but more severe; however the symptoms do not seem to improve with delta-9-THC. The differences in presentation could be due to the fact that synthetic products may contain several heterogeneous compounds, including amphetamine-like substances. CONCLUSIONS. The acute withdrawal syndrome appears to be characterized mainly by anxiety and tachycardia in the absence of any neurological findings or electrolyte disturbances.

3454,[!] Cannabinoid activation of PPAR alpha; a novel neuroprotective mechanism.,17906680,,2007,"OBJECTIVE. Although CB(1) receptor activation evokes neuroprotection in response to cannabinoids, some cannabinoids have been reported to be peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) ligands, offering an alternative protective mechanism. We have, therefore, investigated the ability of a range of cannabinoids to activate PPAR alpha and for N-oleoylethanolamine (OEA), an endogenous cannabinoid-like compound (ECL), to evoke neuroprotection. METHODS. Assays of PPAR alpha occupancy and gene transactivation potential were conducted in cell-free and transfected HeLa cell preparations, respectively. In vivo estimates of PPAR alpha activation through fat mobilization and gene transcription were conducted in mice. Neuroprotection in vivo was investigated in wild-type and PPAR alpha gene-disrupted mice. RESULTS. The ECLs OEA, anandamide, noladin ether and virodhamine were found to bind to the purified PPAR alpha ligand binding domain and to increase PPAR alpha-driven transcriptional activity. The high affinity synthetic CB(1/2) cannabinoid agonist WIN 55212-2 bound to PPAR alpha equipotently with the PPARalpha agonist fenofibrate, and stimulated PPARalpha-mediated gene transcription. The phytocannabinoid delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol was without effect. OEA and WIN 55212-2 induced lipolysis in vivo, while OEA pre-treatment reduced infarct volume from middle cerebral artery occlusion in wild-type, but not in PPAR alpha-null mice. OEA treatment also led to increased expression of the NFkappa B-inhibitory protein, Ikappa B, in mouse cerebral cortex, while expression of the NFkappa B-regulated protein COX-2 was inhibited. CONCLUSIONS. These data demonstrate the potential for a range of cannabinoid compounds, of diverse structures, to activate PPAR alpha and suggest that at least some of the neuroprotective properties of these agents could be mediated by nuclear receptor activation.",British journal of pharmacology,,lipolysis,,phytocannabinoid,,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Compound: phytocannabinoid; Indication: lipolysis,"Title: [!] Cannabinoid activation of PPAR alpha; a novel neuroprotective mechanism.

Thirty five treatment-seeking, not active co-morbid chronic cannabis dependents (ICD-10) were studied on admission and on abstinence days 8 and 16, using several observational and self-report scales, such as Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). Simultaneously obtained serum was analyzed with regard to levels of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and its main metabolites 11-hydroxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-OH) and 11-nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid (THC-COOH). RESULTS. At admission, nearly 90% of the patients were not, or only mildly, affected by depression, anxiety or manic symptoms. In contrast, patients' self-description indicated a strong psychiatric burden in approximately 60% of the cases. All patients improved significantly within 16 days of the treatment. Effect sizes ranged from 0.7 to 1.4. (Cohen's d) for the respective scales. Serum THC-levels were positively associated with impairment of cognition in HAMA and motor retardation in BPRS. All other test results were not significantly related to the serum levels of the measured cannabinoids. CONCLUSIONS. Effects of the cannabis withdrawal syndrome and executive dysfunctions might explain the discrepancy between the observer ratings and self-reported psychiatric burden. CONCLUSIONS. Inpatient cannabis detoxification treatment significantly improved psychiatric symptoms. Serum THC-levels were not associated with affective symptoms and anxiety but predicted cognitive impairment and motor retardation."

3499,[!] Activation properties of heterologously expressed mammalian TRPV2: evidence for species dependence.,17395593,,2007,"TRPV2 has been proposed as a potential pain target, in part due to its relatedness to the nociceptor TRPV1 and to its reported activation by noxious high temperatures (>52 degrees C). However, TRPV2 responses to heat as well as to the nonselective agonist 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) have not been universally reproduced in other laboratories, leading to debate about the activation properties of this channel. Here, we report the expression of rat, mouse, and human TRPV2 in HEK293 cells and the differential properties of their responses to heat and 2-APB. Expression of mouse or rat TRPV2 in HEK293 cells resulted in robust channel activation when induced by either temperature (>53 degrees C) or 2-APB. By contrast, expression of human TRPV2 did not lead to detectable activation by either of these stimuli. Human TRPV2 protein was expressed at levels comparable with those of rat TRPV2, exhibited similar surface localization and responded to a novelly identified TRPV2 agonist, Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, indicating that human TRPV2 is functionally expressed on the cell surface. Studies using deletion mutants and chimeras between rat and human TRPV2 indicated that both amino- and carboxyl-cytoplasmic termini of rat TRPV2 are important for responses to heat and 2-APB but can be supplied in trans to form an active channel.

3515,[!] Three Patients With Acute Pulmonary Damage Following the Use of E-Cigarettes-A Case Series.,32327029,,2020,"BACKGROUND. The use of e-cigarettes is on the rise around the world. Many case reports of acute lung injury due to e-cigarette use have been published in recent months in the USA, but no comparable cases have emerged in Germany up to the present report. The use of e-cigarettes has risen very rapidly in the USA in recent years, simultaneously with the legalization of marijuana sale in many American states. Most of the cases described there involved the use, not only of nicotine, but of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana) as well, though some of the patients had indeed not used additives (e.g. THC). METHODS. We report three cases in Germany of acute pulmonary illness that we consider to have been caused by the use of e-cigarettes. RESULTS. All three patients were hospitalized for acute shortness of breath. Two displayed partial respiratory insufficiency and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. All three stated that they had used ordinary, commercially available e-cigarettes every day for at least the past three months. In the first patient, a 48-year-old man, the complete blood count and bronchial lavage findings indicated eosinophilic inflammation. The second patient, a 22-year-old man, developed multiple episodes of hemoptysis, with computed tomography (CT) showing diffuse alveolar bleeding; his complete blood count also revealed eosinophilic inflammation. The third patient, a 34-year-old man, displayed acute ground-glass lung opacities as well as fibrosing changes on CT corresponding to pulmonary sarcoidosis.

3528,[!] The anxiolytic-like effects of cannabidiol injected into the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis are mediated by 5-HT1A receptors.,20945065,,2011,"BACKGROUND. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychotomimetic compound from Cannabis sativa that induces anxiolytic-like effects in rodents and humans after systemic administration. Previous results from our group showed that CBD injection into the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) attenuates conditioned aversive responses. The aim of this study was to further investigate the role of this region on the anxiolytic effects of the CBD. Moreover, considering that CBD can activate 5-HT1A receptors, we also verified a possible involvement of these receptors in those effects. METHODS. Male Wistar rats received injections of CBD (15, 30, or 60 nmol) into the BNST and were exposed to the elevated plus-maze (EPM) or to the Vogel conflict test (VCT), two widely used animal models of anxiety. RESULTS. CBD increased open arms exploration in the EPM as well as the number of punished licks in the VCT, suggesting an anxiolytic-like effect. The drug did not change the number of entries into the enclosed arms of the EPM nor interfered with water consumption or nociceptive threshold, discarding potential confounding factors in the two tests. Moreover, pretreatment with the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY100635 (0.37 nmol) blocked the effects of CBD in both models. CONCLUSIONS. These results give further support to the proposal that BNST is involved in the anxiolytic-like effects of CBD observed after systemic administration, probably by facilitating local 5-HT1A receptor-mediated neurotransmission.",Psychopharmacology,,anxiety disorders,,CBD,,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Compound: CBD; Indication: anxiety disorders,"Title: [!] The anxiolytic-like effects of cannabidiol injected into the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis are mediated by 5-HT1A receptors.

The drug did not change the number of entries into the enclosed arms of the EPM nor interfered with water consumption or nociceptive threshold, discarding potential confounding factors in the two tests. Moreover, pretreatment with the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY100635 (0.37 nmol) blocked the effects of CBD in both models. CONCLUSIONS. These results give further support to the proposal that BNST is involved in the anxiolytic-like effects of CBD observed after systemic administration, probably by facilitating local 5-HT1A receptor-mediated neurotransmission."

To study how the varying levels of cannabidiol and THC have an impact on the acute effects of the drug in naturalistic settings. METHODS. Cannabis users (n = 134) were tested 7 days apart on measures of memory and psychotomimetic symptoms, once while they were drug free and once while acutely intoxicated by their own chosen smoked cannabis. Using an unprecedented methodology, a sample of cannabis (as well as saliva) was collected from each user and analysed for levels of cannabinoids.

3634,[!] Multiple sclerosis and extract of cannabis: results of the MUSEC trial.,22791906,,2012,"OBJECTIVE. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with chronic symptoms, including muscle stiffness, spasms, pain and insomnia. Here we report the results of the Multiple Sclerosis and Extract of Cannabis (MUSEC) study that aimed to substantiate the patient based findings of previous studies. METHODS. Patients with stable MS at 22 UK centres were randomised to oral cannabis extract (CE) (N=144) or placebo (N=135), stratified by centre, walking ability and use of antispastic medication. This double blind, placebo controlled, phase III study had a screening period, a 2 week dose titration phase from 5 mg to a maximum of 25 mg of tetrahydrocannabinol daily and a 10 week maintenance phase. The primary outcome measure was a category rating scale (CRS) measuring patient reported change in muscle stiffness from baseline. Further CRSs assessed body pain, spasms and sleep quality. Three validated MS specific patient reported outcome measures assessed aspects of spasticity, physical and psychological impact, and walking ability. RESULTS. The rate of relief from muscle stiffness after 12 weeks was almost twice as high with CE than with placebo (29.4% vs. 15.7%; OR 2.26; 95% CI 1.24 to 4.13; p=0.004, one sided). Similar results were found after 4 weeks and 8 weeks, and also for all further CRSs. Results from the MS scales supported these findings. CONCLUSIONS.

The data included demographic information, duration of fibromyalgia symptoms and diagnosis, duration of MC use, monthly consumption of MC, frequency of daily use, number of species of MC currently used, number of species previously used, types and features of MC supplied, methods of MC consumption, delay in MC supply, symptoms of cannabis withdrawal during delay in supply or shortage of MC, familiarity with the content of- trans-О”вЃ№-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Cannabidiol (CBD) of the current species used. Furthermore, information was retrieved on current medications for fibromyalgia and medications for fibromyalgia stopped after starting MC consumption, discontinuation of MC treatment, companies growing and supplying the currently consumed MC, names of current MC species, dominance of Sativa or Indica of the current MC species, and the impact of MC on clinical parameters such as pain, sleep, anxiety, depression, memory, concentration and weight. In addition, questions were presented regarding work, outdoor leisure time, driving, sharing their own MC with other people, opinion on the reform of MC in Israel and adverse effects of MC. RESULTS. One-hundred and one patients completed the study; 73% of the participants were female with a mean age of 45В±11.8 years. The mean duration of fibromyalgia symptoms and diagnosis were 8.39В±6 and 4.69В±3.9 years, respectively. The mean duration of MC consumption was 15.3В±12.6 months and the mean monthly consumption amount was 28.6В±10.2 g. 54% smoked pure cannabis, 18% used vaporized cannabis only and 3 participants only used MC oil. The rest used a variety of combinations. The mean minimal daily frequency of MC consumption was 4.11В±2.9 times and the mean maximal daily frequency was 7.9В±5.6 times. The mean number of current daily MC species was 2.11В±1 and the mean number of tried species was 6.7В±5.2 for each participant; 47% of all the participants stopped any other treatment for fibromyalgia and 51% reduced the dose or the number of other medications for fibromyalgia. One patient only stopped MC treatment. Tikun Olam was the manufacturing company with the largest number of clients and its most popular species for daytime was ""Alaska"" and ""Erez"" for night-time. Mean improvement in sleep and pain was slightly more than 77% with less improvement in other parameters; 36% of the patients reported weight gain, while 16% reported weight loss; 51% reported having more leisure time outdoors. Nearly all patients refused sharing any amount of their MC with friends or family members, and all patients recommended MC treatment for their loved ones once they develop severe fibromyalgia; 61% of the participants were against the reform of MC and 11% were in favor of it.

Recent years have seen substantial shifts in cultural attitudes towards cannabis for medical and recreational use. However, legalizing recreational marijuana may have adverse effects on individual and public health. As the most widely used illicit agent, cannabis is commonly reported to disrupt learning and memory. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms underlying behavioral impairment by cannabis abuse remain poorly understood. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a major component in cannabis, causes short-term effects on the visual system, but little is known about persisting visual disturbances. This study was to investigate the effects of systemic administration with THC on retina and explore its underlying mechanisms. BALB/c mice were treated with 1 or 2 mg/kg THC intraperitoneally daily for 2 months, mice treated with vehicle as negative control.

We discovered that cell death is induced in the leaf tissues exposed to cannabinoid resin secreted from the glands, and identified cannabichromenic acid (CBCA) and Delta(1)-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) as unique cell death mediators from the resin. These cannabinoids effectively induced cell death in the leaf cells or suspension-cultured cells of C. sativa, whereas pretreatment with the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) inhibitor cyclosporin A suppressed this cell death response. Examinations using isolated mitochondria demonstrated that CBCA and THCA mediate opening of MPT pores without requiring Ca(2+) and other cytosolic factors, resulting in high amplitude mitochondrial swelling, release of mitochondrial proteins (cytochrome c and nuclease), and irreversible loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Therefore, CBCA and THCA are considered to cause serious damage to mitochondria through MPT. The mitochondrial damage was also confirmed by a marked decrease of ATP level in cannabinoid-treated suspension cells. These features are in good accord with those of necrotic cell death, whereas DNA degradation was also observed in cannabinoid-mediated cell death.

Memantine and marijuana smoking have been found to inhibit tremor in parkinsonian patients, although the observed effects were relatively weak. The tremorolytic effects of combinations of memantine and cannabinoids have not been studied. Here, we have evaluated the anti-tremor activity of memantine, О”-9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) given alone and of their combination. The involvement of some neuroanatomical structures in the effects of the combination was evaluated. Haloperidol-induced tremulous jaw movements (TJMs) in rats were used as a model of parkinsonian-like tremor. To evaluate the role of central receptor systems in the drug effects, receptor ligands were administered locally into certain brain areas. Memantine and THC alone were without effect, although co-administration of these drugs decreased the number of haloperidol-induced jaw movements. The anti-tremor activity of the combination was antagonized (a) by injections of l-glutamate into the dorsal striatum, entopeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra pars reticulata, globus pallidus, and supratrigeminal and trigeminal motor nuclei but not into the subthalamic and cuneiform nuclei; (b) by injections of CGS 21680 into the ventrolateral striatum; and (c) by injections of bicuculline into the rostral part of the parvicellular reticular nucleus.

Central cannabinoid systems have been implicated in appetite regulation by the respective hyperphagic actions of exogenous cannabinoids, such as delta9-THC, and hypophagic effects of selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists. OBJECTIVE. This study examined whether an endogenous cannabinoid, anandamide, could induce overeating, via a specific action at central (CB1) cannabinoid receptors. METHODS. Pre-satiated male rats (n=18), received subcutaneous injections of anandamide (0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0 mg/kg) before 3-h, nocturnal food intake tests. In a second series of intake tests (n=8), anandamide injection (1.0 mg/kg) was preceded by injection of the specific CB1 receptor antagonist, SR141716 (0.1, 0.5, 1.0 mg/kg SC). RESULTS.

The selective cannabinoid receptor antagonist SR 141716A blocked the effects elicited by delta9-THC on delta opioid receptor desensitization, down-regulation and gene expression; thus indicating that these are mediated via activation of cannabinoid receptors. These data demonstrate the existence, in NG 108-15 cells, of a complex cross-talk between the cannabinoid and opioid receptors on prolonged exposure to delta9-THC triggered by changes in signaling through Gi and/or G0-coupled receptors."

THC can be measured in blood up to a month after last intake in heavy cannabis users. The cognitive deficits during abstinence have been hypothesized to be at least in part due to residual THC in brain. To which extent THC accumulation will occur after occasional cannabis use has gained limited attention. We aimed to predict THC-levels between smoking sessions in non-daily as well as daily cannabis users and to compare these predictions with published THC levels. METHODS. Predictions were based on pharmacokinetic principles on drug accumulation after repeated dosing, applied to different cannabis smoking patterns, using data from a three-compartment model for THC pharmacokinetics and results on the terminal elimination half-life of THC in humans. We searched the literature for THC measurements which could be compared with these predictions. We found no such results from controlled studies of long-term repeated cannabis consumption of known THC amounts. Thirteen published studies contained, however, enough information on cannabis use and results from THC-measurements to make tentative comparisons with the predictions. RESULTS. The predictions of THC-plasma levels present after different cannabis smoking patterns assuming terminal elimination half-lives of THC of 21.5 h or longer, had some support in published THC levels measured in individuals self-reporting their cannabis consumption. We found no consistent discrepancies between the predictions and reported THC plasma levels after non-daily or daily cannabis use. The predictions indicate that THC might be present in plasma between smoking sessions above usual analytical limits when smoking every third and second day, and at lower levels after once weekly smoking. CONCLUSIONS. The study indicates that THC might be present continuously even in non-daily smokers at low levels, even if the smoking occasions are separated by a week. This is different from alcohol, where ethanol has disappeared after a day.

3932,[!] Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol decreases masticatory muscle sensitization in female rats through peripheral cannabinoid receptor activation.,28722246,,2017,"This study investigated whether intramuscular injection of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), by acting on peripheral cannabinoid (CB) receptors, could decrease nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced sensitization in female rat masseter muscle; a model which mimics the symptoms of myofascial temporomandibular disorders. Immunohistochemistry was used to explore the peripheral expression of cannabinoid receptors in the masseter muscle while behavioural and electrophysiology experiments were employed to assess the functional effects of intramuscular injection of THC. It was found that CB1 and CB2 receptors are expressed by trigeminal ganglion neurons that innervate the masseter muscle and also on their peripheral endings. Their expression was greater in TRPV1-positive ganglion neurons. Three days after intramuscular injection of NGF, ganglion neuron expression of CB1 and CB2, but not TPRV1, was decreased. In behavioural experiments, intramuscular injection (10В ОјL) of THC (1В mg/mL) attenuated NGF-induced mechanical sensitization. No change in mechanical threshold was observed in the contralateral masseter muscles and no impairment of motor function was found after intramuscular injections of THC. In anaesthetized rats, the same concentration of THC increased the mechanical thresholds of masseter muscle mechanoreceptors. Co-administration of the CB1 antagonist AM251 blocked the effect of THC on masseter muscle mechanoreceptors while the CB2 antagonist AM630 had no effect. These results suggest that reduced inhibitory input from the peripheral cannabinoid system may contribute to NGF-induced local myofascial sensitization of mechanoreceptors. Peripheral application of THC may counter this effect by activating the CB1 receptors on masseter muscle mechanoreceptors to provide analgesic relief without central side effects.

This study investigated whether intramuscular injection of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), by acting on peripheral cannabinoid (CB) receptors, could decrease nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced sensitization in female rat masseter muscle; a model which mimics the symptoms of myofascial temporomandibular disorders. Immunohistochemistry was used to explore the peripheral expression of cannabinoid receptors in the masseter muscle while behavioural and electrophysiology experiments were employed to assess the functional effects of intramuscular injection of THC. It was found that CB1 and CB2 receptors are expressed by trigeminal ganglion neurons that innervate the masseter muscle and also on their peripheral endings. Their expression was greater in TRPV1-positive ganglion neurons. Three days after intramuscular injection of NGF, ganglion neuron expression of CB1 and CB2, but not TPRV1, was decreased. In behavioural experiments, intramuscular injection (10В ОјL) of THC (1В mg/mL) attenuated NGF-induced mechanical sensitization. No change in mechanical threshold was observed in the contralateral masseter muscles and no impairment of motor function was found after intramuscular injections of THC. In anaesthetized rats, the same concentration of THC increased the mechanical thresholds of masseter muscle mechanoreceptors. Co-administration of the CB1 antagonist AM251 blocked the effect of THC on masseter muscle mechanoreceptors while the CB2 antagonist AM630 had no effect. These results suggest that reduced inhibitory input from the peripheral cannabinoid system may contribute to NGF-induced local myofascial sensitization of mechanoreceptors. Peripheral application of THC may counter this effect by activating the CB1 receptors on masseter muscle mechanoreceptors to provide analgesic relief without central side effects. Our results suggest THC could reduce masticatory muscle pain through activating peripheral CB1 receptors. Peripheral application of cannabinoids could be a novel approach to provide analgesic relief without central side effects."

METHODS. In this study, diagnostic tests on 102 male patients suspected with cannabis abuse were done. Liquid-liquid extraction of cannabinoids from urine was done and screened by Duquenois-Levine, fast blue B salt and p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (p-DMAB) tests.

4064,[!] The pharmacological activity of inhalation exposure to marijuana smoke in mice.,11376914,,2001,"Although the majority of cannabinoid users smoke marijuana, the preponderance of laboratory animal research is based on administration of Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta9-THC) or other cannabinoid agents via injection. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of inhaling marijuana, or ethanol-extracted placebo smoke in the mouse model of cannabinoid activity by assessing inhibition of spontaneous activity, antinociception, catalepsy, and body temperature. In order to determine dosimetry, blood levels of Delta9-THC were obtained following either marijuana exposure or intravenous injection of Delta(9)-THC. Inhalation exposure to marijuana produced dose-related increases in antinociception and catalepsy, with estimated ED50 doses of Delta9-THC of 2.4 and 3.8 mg/kg, respectively. However, hypothermia and locomotor depression occurred in both the placebo- and marijuana-exposed mice. The CB1 receptor antagonist, SR 141716A antagonized the antinociceptive effects of marijuana (AD50 = 0.6 mg/kg), but only slightly decreased marijuana-induced catalepsy, and failed to alter either the hypothermic or locomotor depressive effects.

Cannabis is commonly used by humans to relieve stress. OBJECTIVE. Here, we evaluate the potential of intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered О”-9-tetrahydrocannabiol (THC) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA, the precursor of cannabidiol [CBD]) to produce dose-dependent effects on anxiety-like responding in the light-dark (LD) emergence test of anxiety-like responding in rats, when administered acutely or chronically (21В days). As well, we evaluate the potential of THC, CBDA, and CBD to reduce anxiogenic responding produced by foot shock (FS) stress 24В h prior to the LD test. RESULTS. In the absence of the explicit FS stressor, THC (1 and 10В mg/kg) produced anxiogenic-like responding when administered acutely or chronically, but CBDA produced neither anxiogenic- nor anxiolytic-like responding.

We examined whether the CBD antihyperalgesic effect could be mediated by cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) or cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2) and/or by transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1). Rats received CBD (10 mg kg(-1)) and the selective antagonists: SR141716 (N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide) for CB1, SR144528 (N-[(1S)-endo-1,3,3-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-yl]-5-(4-chloro-3-methylphenyl)-1-(4-methylbenzyl)pyrazole-3 carboxamide) for CB2 and capsazepine (CPZ) for TRPV1 receptors. The intraplantar injection of carrageenan in rats induced a time-dependent thermal hyperalgesia, which peaked at 3 h and decreased at the following times.

Cannabidiol (CBD), a nonpsychoactive marijuana constituent, was recently shown as an oral antihyperalgesic compound in a rat model of acute inflammation. We examined whether the CBD antihyperalgesic effect could be mediated by cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) or cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2) and/or by transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1). Rats received CBD (10 mg kg(-1)) and the selective antagonists: SR141716 (N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide) for CB1, SR144528 (N-[(1S)-endo-1,3,3-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-yl]-5-(4-chloro-3-methylphenyl)-1-(4-methylbenzyl)pyrazole-3 carboxamide) for CB2 and capsazepine (CPZ) for TRPV1 receptors. The intraplantar injection of carrageenan in rats induced a time-dependent thermal hyperalgesia, which peaked at 3 h and decreased at the following times. CBD, administered 2 h after carrageenan, abolished the hyperalgesia to the thermal stimulus evaluated by plantar test. Neither SR141716 (0.5 mg kg(-1)) nor SR144528 (3 and 10 mg kg(-1)) modified the CBD-induced antihyperalgesia; CPZ partially at the lowest dose (2 mg kg(-1)) and fully at the highest dose (10 mg kg(-1)) reversed this effect.

All children had extensive work-ups before the diagnosis was made; 2 were discharged home and 1 was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: As access to marijuana increases with growing legalization, it is important to be familiar with state marijuana legislation, to consider and ask families about access to marijuana products as a potential contributor to altered mental status, and to be aware of potential caretaker reluctance regarding disclosure of marijuana use secondary to perceived stigma.

4226,[!] Use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for definitive diagnosis of synthetic cannabinoid toxicity in a dog.,31342645,AB-CHMINACA; canine; seizure; tetrahydrocannabinol; toxicology,2019,"OBJECTIVE. To report the use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of synthetic cannabis toxicosis in a dog and to describe the clinical course of the intoxication. METHODS. An 11-year-old neutered female Boxer dog was referred due to acute onset of vomiting, ataxia, dull mentation, and delirium that progressed to generalized seizures, unresponsive to diazepam. Prior to presentation, the dog was found lying down, minimally responsive with vomitus around it. A chewed bag containing dried plant material was found next to the dog. The dog was anesthetized and ventilated with positive pressure for 16 hours, and eventually made a full recovery. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the plant material and a plasma sample from the dog revealed presence of the synthetic cannabinoid N-[(1S)-1-(aminocarbonyl)-2-methylpropyl]-1-(cyclohexylmethyl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide, also known as AB-CHMINACA, a relatively new illegal synthetic cannabinoid, known by the local forensic police department as a drug of recreational abuse.

Patients suffering from schizophrenic psychosis show reduced synaptic connectivity compared to healthy individuals. Furthermore, the use of cannabis often precedes the onset of schizophrenic psychosis. Therefore, we investigated whether consumption of cannabis has an impact on the methylation pattern of schizophrenia candidate genes concerned with the development and preservation of synapses and synaptic function. METHODS. Fifty blood samples of outpatients affected by treatment-resistant schizophrenic psychosis were collected in the outpatient department of Ch Ste Anne/INSERM (Paris, France). Extracted DNA was sent to the LMN/MHH (Hanover, Germany) where DNA samples were bisulfite converted. The methylation patterns of the promoter region of neuregulin 1 (NRG1), neurexin (NRXN1), disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), and microtubule-associated-protein tau (MAPT) were then analysed by sequencing according to Sanger. RESULTS. In NRXN1 the group of non-consumer patients showed a methylation rate slightly lower than controls. In patients with preliminary use of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) the NRXN1 promoter turned out to be methylated almost two times higher than in non-consumer patients.

Therefore, CT-3 may be an effective analgesic for poorly controlled resistant neuropathic pain. OBJECTIVE. To examine the analgesic efficacy and safety of CT-3 in chronic neuropathic pain in humans. METHODS. Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial conducted in Germany from May-September 2002. METHODS. Twenty-one patients (8 women and 13 men) aged 29 to 65 years (mean, 51 years) who had a clinical presentation and examination consistent with chronic neuropathic pain (for at least 6 months) with hyperalgesia (n = 21) and allodynia (n = 7). METHODS. Patients were randomized to two 7-day treatment orders in a crossover design. Two daily doses of CT-3 (four 10-mg capsules per day) or identical placebo capsules were given during the first 4 days and 8 capsules per day were given in 2 daily doses in the following 3 days. After a washout and baseline period of 1 week each, patients crossed over to the second 7-day treatment period. METHODS. Visual analog scale (VAS) and verbal rating scale scores for pain; vital sign, hematologic and blood chemistry, and electrocardiogram measurements; scores on the Trail-Making Test and the Addiction Research Center Inventory-Marijuana scale; and adverse effects. RESULTS. The mean differences over time for the VAS values in the CT-3-placebo sequence measured 3 hours after intake of study drug differed significantly from those in the placebo-CT-3 sequence (mean [SD], -11.54 [14.16] vs 9.86 [21.43]; P =.02). Eight hours after intake of the drug, the pain scale differences between groups were less marked. No dose response was observed. Adverse effects, mainly transient dry mouth and tiredness, were reported significantly more often during CT-3 treatment (mean [SD] difference, -0.67 [0.50] for CT-3-placebo sequence vs 0.10 [0.74] for placebo-CT-3 sequence; P =.02). There were no significant differences with respect to vital signs, blood tests, electrocardiogram, Trail-Making Test, and Addiction Research Center Inventory-Marijuana scale.

BACKGROUND. 1',1'dimethylheptyl-Delta8-tetrahydrocannabinol-11-oic acid (CT-3), a potent analog of THC-11-oic acid, produces marked antiallodynic and analgesic effects in animals without evoking the typical effects described in models of cannabinoids. Therefore, CT-3 may be an effective analgesic for poorly controlled resistant neuropathic pain. OBJECTIVE. To examine the analgesic efficacy and safety of CT-3 in chronic neuropathic pain in humans. METHODS. Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial conducted in Germany from May-September 2002. METHODS. Twenty-one patients (8 women and 13 men) aged 29 to 65 years (mean, 51 years) who had a clinical presentation and examination consistent with chronic neuropathic pain (for at least 6 months) with hyperalgesia (n = 21) and allodynia (n = 7).

Cannabis use peaks during adolescence with a trend for continued consumption by adults. Notably, several studies have shown that long-term and heavy cannabis use during adolescence can impair brain maturation and predispose to neurodevelopmental disorders, although the neurobiological mechanisms underlying this association remain largely unknown. In this study, we evaluated whether, in female rats, chronic administration of increasing doses of the psychotropic plant-derived cannabis constituent, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), during adolescence (PND 35-45) could affect microglia function in the long-term. Furthermore, we explored a possible contribution of microglia to the development of THC-induced alterations in mood and cognition in adult female rats.

Subjects were tested on the following four tasks: the Stop task, which measures the ability to inhibit a prepotent motor response; a Go/no-go task; a Delay discounting task, which measures the value of delayed or uncertain reinforcers; and a time estimation task, which measures alterations in time perception through a time reproduction procedure. Subjects also completed mood questionnaires and general measures of performance. THC produced its expected effects on subjective measures including increases in ARCI euphoria and marijuana scales. THC increased impulsive responding on the Stop task but did not affect performance on either the Go/no-go or Delay or Probability discounting tasks.

The dissociations between the four measures of impulsivity suggest that impulsivity is an assemblage of distinct components rather than a unitary process."

4399,[!] Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is effective in the treatment of tics in Tourette syndrome: a 6-week randomized trial.,12716250,,2003,"BACKGROUND. Preliminary studies suggested that delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive ingredient of Cannabis sativa L., might be effective in the treatment of Tourette syndrome (TS). This study was performed to investigate for the first time under controlled conditions, over a longer-term treatment period, whether THC is effective and safe in reducing tics in TS. METHODS. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 24 patients with TS, according to DSM-III-R criteria, were treated over a 6-week period with up to 10 mg/day of THC. Tics were rated at 6 visits (visit 1, baseline; visits 2-4, during treatment period; visits 5-6, after withdrawal of medication) using the Tourette Syndrome Clinical Global Impressions scale (TS-CGI), the Shapiro Tourette-Syndrome Severity Scale (STSSS), the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS), the self-rated Tourette Syndrome Symptom List (TSSL), and a videotape-based rating scale. RESULTS. Seven patients dropped out of the study or had to be excluded, but only 1 due to side effects. Using the TS-CGI, STSSS, YGTSS, and video rating scale, we found a significant difference (p <.05) or a trend toward a significant difference (p <.10) between THC and placebo groups at visits 2, 3, and/or 4. Using the TSSL at 10 treatment days (between days 16 and 41) there was a significant difference (p <.05) between both groups. ANOVA as well demonstrated a significant difference (p =.037).

Quantification of cannabinoids in breastmilk is essential for clinical monitoring and research studies and breastmilk banks mainly rely on ELISA in terms of screening for cannabinoids. To support clinical studies on disposition of cannabinoids in breastmilk, we validated a high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) assay for the simultaneous quantification of 12 cannabinoids and their metabolites in human breast milk. Said assay was based upon a simple one-step protein precipitation, online column extraction and detection in the positive multiple reaction monitoring mode. After successful validation, the assay was used to analyze 30 samples from a clinical research study that had tested negative using an ELISA kit that is commonly used by breastmilk banks. In human breast milk, depending on the analyte, the lower limits of quantification of the LC-MS-MS assay ranged from 0.39 to 7.81 ng/mL. Acceptance criteria for intra- and inter-batch accuracy (85-115%) and imprecision (<15%) were met for all compounds. Mean extraction efficiencies were above 60% for all analytes. Mean matrix effect ranged from -12.5% to 44.5% except of THC- glucuronide for which significant matrix effects were noted. No carry-over was detected.

Cannabis use has been associated with psychosis through exposure to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (О”9-THC), its key psychoactive ingredient.

METHODS. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study investigated whether sensitivity to the psychotomimetic effects of О”9-THC moderates the acute effects of a single О”9-THC dose (1.19 mg/2 ml) on myo-inositol levels, a surrogate marker of glia, in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC), and circadian cortisol levels, the key neuroendocrine marker of the HPA-axis, in a set of 16 healthy participants (seven males) with modest previous cannabis exposure.

Neither cannabis smoke nor THC exposure during adolescence produced robust alterations in adult behavior after a period of abstinence, suggesting that adverse effects associated with adolescent cannabis use might be due to non-cannabinoid concomitants of cannabis use."

But the physiological significance of this observation and its potential therapeutic value are obscured by the fact that some asthmatic patients respond to these compounds with a paradoxical bronchospasm. The mechanisms underlying these contrasting responses remain unresolved. Here we show that the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide exerts dual effects on bronchial responsiveness in rodents: it strongly inhibits bronchospasm and cough evoked by the chemical irritant, capsaicin, but causes bronchospasm when the constricting tone exerted by the vagus nerve is removed. Both effects are mediated through peripheral CB1 cannabinoid receptors found on axon terminals of airway nerves. Biochemical analyses indicate that anandamide is synthesized in lung tissue on calcium-ion stimulation, suggesting that locally generated anandamide participates in the intrinsic control of airway responsiveness. In support of this conclusion, the CB1 antagonist SR141716A enhances capsaicin-evoked bronchospasm and cough.

Furthermore, increasing О”-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in high-potency cannabis is accompanied by a decrease in cannabidiol (CBD), thus an understanding of the interactions between CBD and THC in the neurodevelopmental effects of THC is also important. The current study examined the immediate and long-term behavioral consequences of THC, CBD, and their combination in a mouse model of adolescent cannabis use. Materials and Methods: Male CD1 mice received daily injections of THC (3вЂ‰mg/kg), CBD (3вЂ‰mg/kg), CBD+THC (3вЂ‰mg/kg each), vehicle, or remained undisturbed in their home cage (no handling/injections), either during adolescence (postnatal day [PND] 28-48) or during early adulthood (PND 69-89). Animals were then evaluated with a battery of behavioral tests 1 day after drug treatment, and again after 42 drug-free days. The tests included the following: open field (day 1), novel object recognition (NOR; day 2), marble burying (day 3), elevated plus maze (EPM; day 4), and Nestlet shredding (day 5). Results: Chronic administration of THC during adolescence led to immediate and long-term impairments in object recognition/working memory, as measured by the NOR task. In contrast, adult administration of THC caused immediate, but not long term, impairment of object/working memory. Adolescent chronic exposure to THC increased repetitive and compulsive-like behaviors, as measured by the Nestlet shredding task. Chronic administration of THC, either during adolescence or during adulthood, led to a delayed increase in anxiety as measured by the EPM. All THC-induced behavioral abnormalities were prevented by the coadministration of CBD+THC, whereas CBD alone did not influence behavioral outcomes. Conclusion: These data suggest that chronic exposure to THC during adolescence leads to some of the behavioral abnormalities common in schizophrenia. Interestingly, CBD appeared to antagonize all THC-induced behavioral abnormalities. These findings support the hypothesis that adolescent THC use can impart long-term behavioral deficits; however, cotreatment with CBD prevents these deficits."
4538,[!] Behavioral Characterization of the Effects of Cannabis Smoke and Anandamide in Rats.,27065006,,2016,"Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug in the world. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (О”9-THC) is the main psychoactive component of cannabis and its effects have been well-studied. However, cannabis contains many other cannabinoids that affect brain function. Therefore, these studies investigated the effect of cannabis smoke exposure on locomotor activity, rearing, anxiety-like behavior, and the development of dependence in rats. It was also investigated if cannabis smoke exposure leads to tolerance to the locomotor-suppressant effects of the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide. Cannabis smoke was generated by burning 5.7% О”9-THC cannabis cigarettes in a smoking machine. The effect of cannabis smoke on the behavior of rats in a small and large open field and an elevated plus maze was evaluated. Cannabis smoke exposure induced a brief increase in locomotor activity followed by a prolonged decrease in locomotor activity and rearing in the 30-min small open field test. The cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) receptor antagonist rimonabant increased locomotor activity and prevented the smoke-induced decrease in rearing. Smoke exposure also increased locomotor activity in the 5-min large open field test and the elevated plus maze test. The smoke exposed rats spent more time in the center zone of the large open field, which is indicative of a decrease in anxiety-like behavior. A high dose of anandamide decreased locomotor activity and rearing in the small open field and this was not prevented by rimonabant or pre-exposure to cannabis smoke. Serum О”9-THC levels were 225 ng/ml after smoke exposure, which is similar to levels in humans after smoking cannabis. Exposure to cannabis smoke led to dependence as indicated by more rimonabant-precipitated somatic withdrawal signs in the cannabis smoke exposed rats than in the air-control rats.

Drug use and risky driving is associated with sensation seeking. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between use of psychoactive substances and levels of the sensation seeking personality trait as measured with the Brief Sensation Seeking Scale 4 among drivers in Norway. METHODS. A cross-sectional design was applied to estimate the association between psychoactive substance use and sensation seeking behavior. Drivers in normal traffic were included in two roadside surveys: one in the north (September 2014 October 2015) and the other in the south-east of Norway (April 2016 April 2017). Oral fluid was analyzed for alcohol and psychoactive drugs, and data on sex, age and time of participation were recorded. Participants filled in the Brief Sensation Seeking Scale 4 questionnaire. RESULTS. A total of 8053 drivers were included, of which 32% were women and 62% were under 40вЂ‰years. The prevalence of alcohol was 0.3%, stimulants 0.6%, tetrahydrocannabinol 1.4%, benzodiazepines and/or z-hypnotics 2.0% and polydrug use 0.6%.

4559,[!] Phase I hydroxylated metabolites of the K2 synthetic cannabinoid JWH-018 retain in vitro and in vivo cannabinoid 1 receptor affinity and activity.,21755008,,2011,"BACKGROUND. K2 products are synthetic cannabinoid-laced, marijuana-like drugs of abuse, use of which is often associated with clinical symptoms atypical of marijuana use, including hypertension, agitation, hallucinations, psychosis, seizures and panic attacks. JWH-018, a prevalent K2 synthetic cannabinoid, is structurally distinct from О”(9)-THC, the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. Since even subtle structural differences can lead to differential metabolism, formation of novel, biologically active metabolites may be responsible for the distinct effects associated with K2 use. The present study proposes that K2's high adverse effect occurrence is due, at least in part, to distinct JWH-018 metabolite activity at the cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R). RESULTS. JWH-018, five potential monohydroxylated metabolites (M1-M5), and one carboxy metabolite (M6) were examined in mouse brain homogenates containing CB1Rs, first for CB1R affinity using a competition binding assay employing the cannabinoid receptor radioligand [(3)H]CP-55,940, and then for CB1R intrinsic efficacy using an [(35)S]GTPОіS binding assay. JWH-018 and M1-M5 bound CB1Rs with high affinity, exhibiting K(i) values that were lower than or equivalent to О”(9)-THC. These molecules also stimulated G-proteins with equal or greater efficacy relative to О”(9)-THC, a CB1R partial agonist. Most importantly, JWH-018, M2, M3, and M5 produced full CB1R agonist levels of activation. CB1R-mediated activation was demonstrated by blockade with O-2050, a CB1R-selective neutral antagonist. Similar to О”(9)-THC, JWH-018 and M1 produced a marked depression of locomotor activity and core body temperature in mice that were both blocked by the CB1R-preferring antagonist/inverse agonist AM251. CONCLUSIONS. Unlike metabolites of most drugs, the studied JWH-018 monohydroxylated compounds, but not the carboxy metabolite, retain in vitro and in vivo activity at CB1Rs.

Cannabis availability with high concentrations of О”-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and a range of THC to cannabidiol (CBD) ratios has increased in parallel with a rise in daily cannabis consumption by adolescents. Unanswered questions in adolescents include: 1) whether THC blood concentrations and THC metabolites remain stable or change with prolonged daily dosing, 2) whether CBD modulates THC pharmacokinetic properties and alters THC accumulation in brain, 3) whether blood THC levels reflect brain concentrations. METHODS. In adolescent squirrel monkeys (Saimiri boliviensis), we determined whether a four-month regimen of daily THC (1 mg/kg) or CBD (3 mg/kg) + THC (1 mg/kg) administration (IM) affects THC, THC metabolites, and CBD concentrations in blood or brain. RESULTS. Blood THC concentrations, THC metabolites and CBD remained stable during chronic treatment. 24 h after the final THC or CBD + THC injection, blood THC and CBD concentrations remained relatively high (THC: 6.0-11 ng/mL; CBD: 9.7-19 ng/mL). THC concentrations in cerebellum and occipital cortex were approximately twice those in blood 24 h after the last dose and did not significantly differ in subjects given THC or CBD + THC. CONCLUSIONS. In adolescent monkeys, blood levels of THC, its metabolites or CBD remain stable after daily dosing for four months. Our model suggests that any pharmacological interactions between CBD and THC are unlikely to result from CBD modulation of THC pharmacokinetics.

As secondary outcome measures we evaluated the brain cortical excitability by using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. Both parameters were taken before and after the end of the RAGT. RESULTS.

BACKGROUND. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, affecting ambulation even in people with only mild neurological signs. Patients with MS frequently experience spasticity, which contributes significantly to impair their motor functions, including ambulation, owing to muscle stiffness, spasms, and pain. OBJECTIVE. To clarify the role of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol(THC):cannabidiol(CBD) oromucosal spray, coupled to robot-aided gait training (RAGT) using the LokomatВ©Pro to improve functional ambulation in patients with MS. METHODS. We compared 20 patients with MS, who were treated with THC:CBD oromucosal spray in add-on to the ongoing oral antispastic therapy (OAT) (group A), with 20 individuals with MS (matched for clinical-demographic characteristics) who were treated only with OAT (group B).

In the present study, we observed the protective effects of CBD against neural mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis in a rat model of HS. In addition, CBD increased Beclin-1 and LC3II expression and reduced P62 expression, which were indicative of autophagy. CBD treatment attenuated the neural apoptosis induced by HS, as reflected by restoring mitochondrial dysfunction, downregulation of BAX, neuro-apoptosis ratio and NF-ОєB signaling activation, and upregulation of BCL2 in the cerebral cortex.

4766,[!] Cannabinol and cannabidiol exert opposing effects on rat feeding patterns.,22543671,,2012,"BACKGROUND. Increased food consumption following в€†(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol-induced cannabinoid type 1 receptor agonism is well documented. However, possible non-в€†(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol phytocannabinoid-induced feeding effects have yet to be fully investigated. Therefore, we have assessed the effects of the individual phytocannabinoids, cannabigerol, cannabidiol and cannabinol, upon feeding behaviors. METHODS. Adult male rats were treated (p.o.) with cannabigerol, cannabidiol, cannabinol or cannabinol plus the CB(1)R antagonist, SR141716A. Prior to treatment, rats were satiated and food intake recorded following drug administration. Data were analyzed for hourly intake and meal microstructure. RESULTS. Cannabinol induced a CB(1)R-mediated increase in appetitive behaviors via significant reductions in the latency to feed and increases in consummatory behaviors via increases in meal 1 size and duration. Cannabinol also significantly increased the intake during hour 1 and total chow consumed during the test. Conversely, cannabidiol significantly reduced total chow consumption over the test period. Cannabigerol administration induced no changes to feeding behavior. CONCLUSIONS. This is the first time cannabinol has been shown to increase feeding. Therefore, cannabinol could, in the future, provide an alternative to the currently used and psychotropic в€†(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol-based medicines since cannabinol is currently considered to be non-psychotropic.

We evaluated the effect of the CB(1)/CB(2) receptor agonist delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta(9)-THC) on TLESRs in dogs. Based on these findings, the effect of delta(9)-THC was studied in healthy volunteers. METHODS. In dogs, manometry was used to evaluate the effect of delta(9)-THC in the presence and absence of the CB(1) receptor antagonist SR141716A on TLESRs induced by gastric distension. Secondly, the effect of 10 and 20 mg delta(9)-THC was studied in 18 healthy volunteers in a placebo-controlled study. Manometry was performed before and for 3 h after meal ingestion on three occasions. RESULTS. In dogs, delta(9)-THC dose-dependently inhibited TLESRs and reduced acid reflux rate. SR141716A significantly reversed the effects of delta(9)-THC on TLESRs. Similarly, in healthy volunteers, delta(9)-THC significantly reduced the number of TLESRs and caused a non-significant reduction of acid reflux episodes in the first postprandial hour.

In vitro studies on synaptic membranes isolated from rat brain.,148840,,1976,"The understanding of the effects of cannabinoids in human subjects has been obscured by a lack of knowledge about how the various active principles from marijuana act at the cellular level in the brain. For this reason the present study was undertaken to determine the effects of cannabinoids on the enzymes associated with the synaptic membranes. Electron micrographic analysis was performed to determine the purity of synaptic membrane preparations from rat brain, and subsequently such preparations were subjected to additions of ethanol, Tween-80, 80% glycerol, and either delta-tetrahydrocannabinol, 11-hydroxy-delta-tetrahydrocannabinol, or cannabinol. Both sodium and potassium activated ATPase (Na, K-ATPase), and Mg-ATPase were measured as the micrometer orthophosphate (P) released per minute per microgram membrane protein and these specific activities of the enzymes expressed as absolute values and as the percentage depression brought about by the cannabinoids. The ATPase spcific activities are taken from the rate curve over a 30-min incubation time. Additionally, synaptic membrane acetylcholineesterase specific activity was measured by continuous rate enzyme assay.

I. In vitro studies on synaptic membranes isolated from rat brain.
The understanding of the effects of cannabinoids in human subjects has been obscured by a lack of knowledge about how the various active principles from marijuana act at the cellular level in the brain. For this reason the present study was undertaken to determine the effects of cannabinoids on the enzymes associated with the synaptic membranes. Electron micrographic analysis was performed to determine the purity of synaptic membrane preparations from rat brain, and subsequently such preparations were subjected to additions of ethanol, Tween-80, 80% glycerol, and either delta-tetrahydrocannabinol, 11-hydroxy-delta-tetrahydrocannabinol, or cannabinol. Both sodium and potassium activated ATPase (Na, K-ATPase), and Mg-ATPase were measured as the micrometer orthophosphate (P) released per minute per microgram membrane protein and these specific activities of the enzymes expressed as absolute values and as the percentage depression brought about by the cannabinoids. The ATPase spcific activities are taken from the rate curve over a 30-min incubation time. Additionally, synaptic membrane acetylcholineesterase specific activity was measured by continuous rate enzyme assay. While as low as 10 M delta-tetrahydrocannabinol showed appreciable decrements in both the membrane-bound ATPases, the other cannabinoids did not show such a great depression in enzyme activity. The specific activity of acetylcholinesterase, which is weakly bound to the membrane, showed only slight or no changes in activity with the various cannabinoids.

4819,[!] THC Prevents MDMA Neurotoxicity in Mice.,20174577,,2010,"The majority of MDMA (ecstasy) recreational users also consume cannabis. Despite the rewarding effects that both drugs have, they induce several opposite pharmacological responses. MDMA causes hyperthermia, oxidative stress and neuronal damage, especially at warm ambient temperature. However, THC, the main psychoactive compound of cannabis, produces hypothermic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Therefore, THC may have a neuroprotective effect against MDMA-induced neurotoxicity. Mice receiving a neurotoxic regimen of MDMA (20 mg/kg x 4) were pretreated with THC (3 mg/kg x 4) at room (21 degrees C) and at warm (26 degrees C) temperature, and body temperature, striatal glial activation and DA terminal loss were assessed. To find out the mechanisms by which THC may prevent MDMA hyperthermia and neurotoxicity, the same procedure was carried out in animals pretreated with the CB(1) receptor antagonist AM251 and the CB(2) receptor antagonist AM630, as well as in CB(1), CB(2) and CB(1)/CB(2) deficient mice. THC prevented MDMA-induced-hyperthermia and glial activation in animals housed at both room and warm temperature. Surprisingly, MDMA-induced DA terminal loss was only observed in animals housed at warm but not at room temperature, and this neurotoxic effect was reversed by THC administration. However, THC did not prevent MDMA-induced hyperthermia, glial activation, and DA terminal loss in animals treated with the CB(1) receptor antagonist AM251, neither in CB(1) and CB(1)/CB(2) knockout mice. On the other hand, THC prevented MDMA-induced hyperthermia and DA terminal loss, but only partially suppressed glial activation in animals treated with the CB(2) cannabinoid antagonist and in CB(2) knockout animals. Our results indicate that THC protects against MDMA neurotoxicity, and suggest that these neuroprotective actions are primarily mediated by the reduction of hyperthermia through the activation of CB(1) receptor, although CB(2) receptors may also contribute to attenuate neuroinflammation in this process.",PloS one,,Neuroinflammation,,THC,,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Compound: THC; Indication: Neuroinflammation,"Title: [!] THC Prevents MDMA Neurotoxicity in Mice.

4866,[!] Antinociceptive and Immune Effects of Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol or Cannabidiol in Male Versus Female Rats with Persistent Inflammatory Pain.,32179573,,2020,"Chronic pain is the most common reason reported for using medical cannabis. The goal of this research was to determine whether the two primary phytocannabinoids, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), are effective treatments for persistent inflammatory pain. In experiment 1, inflammation was induced by intraplantar injection of Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Then THC (0.0-4.0 mg/kg, i.p.) or CBD (0.0-10 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered twice daily for 3 days. On day 4, THC, CBD, or vehicle was administered, and allodynia, hyperalgesia, weight-bearing, locomotor activity, and hindpaw edema were assessed 0.5-4 hours postinjection. In experiment 2, CFA or mineral oil (no-pain control)-treated rats were given THC (2.0 mg/kg, i.p.), CBD (10 mg/kg, i.p.), or vehicle in the same manner as in experiment 1. Four hours postinjection on day 4, serum samples were taken for analysis of cytokines known to influence inflammatory pain: interleukin (IL)-1ОІ, IL-6, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-Оі, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-О± THC dose-dependently reduced pain-related behaviors but did not reduce hindpaw edema, and little tolerance developed to THC's effects. In contrast, CBD effects on inflammatory pain were minimal. THC produced little to no change in serum cytokines, whereas CBD decreased IL-1ОІ, IL-10, and IFN-Оі and increased IL-6.

Chronic pain is the most common reason reported for using medical cannabis. The goal of this research was to determine whether the two primary phytocannabinoids, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), are effective treatments for persistent inflammatory pain. In experiment 1, inflammation was induced by intraplantar injection of Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Then THC (0.0-4.0 mg/kg, i.p.) or CBD (0.0-10 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered twice daily for 3 days. On day 4, THC, CBD, or vehicle was administered, and allodynia, hyperalgesia, weight-bearing, locomotor activity, and hindpaw edema were assessed 0.5-4 hours postinjection. In experiment 2, CFA or mineral oil (no-pain control)-treated rats were given THC (2.0 mg/kg, i.p.), CBD (10 mg/kg, i.p.), or vehicle in the same manner as in experiment 1. Four hours postinjection on day 4, serum samples were taken for analysis of cytokines known to influence inflammatory pain: interleukin (IL)-1ОІ, IL-6, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-Оі, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-О± THC dose-dependently reduced pain-related behaviors but did not reduce hindpaw edema, and little tolerance developed to THC's effects. In contrast, CBD effects on inflammatory pain were minimal. THC produced little to no change in serum cytokines, whereas CBD decreased IL-1ОІ, IL-10, and IFN-Оі and increased IL-6.

Objective: The extent of dermatologistsвЂ™ familiarity with and interest in cannabinoids as therapeutics is unknown. Methods: This study examined dermatology providersвЂ™ knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions on therapeutic cannabinoids using a 20-question online survey. Results: The response rate was 21% (n=531). Most responders thought cannabinoids should be legal for medical treatment (86%). Nearly all (94%) believed it is worthwhile to research dermatologic uses of cannabinoids. 55% reported at least one patient-initiated discussion about cannabinoids in the last year. Yet, 48% were concerned about a negative stigma when proposing cannabinoid therapies to patients. While most responders (86%) were willing to prescribe an FDA-approved cannabinoid as a topical treatment, fewer (71%) were willing to prescribe an oral form. 64% of respondents did not know that cannabidiol is not psychoactive and 29% did not know that tetrahydrocannabinol is psychoactive. Limitations: Limited survey population. Conclusions: Dermatology providers are interested in prescribing cannabinoids and patients are speaking about cannabinoids with their dermatologists. However, providersвЂ™ fund of knowledge on this subject is lacking.

Methods: This study examined dermatology providersвЂ™ knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions on therapeutic cannabinoids using a 20-question online survey. Results: The response rate was 21% (n=531). Most responders thought cannabinoids should be legal for medical treatment (86%). Nearly all (94%) believed it is worthwhile to research dermatologic uses of cannabinoids. 55% reported at least one patient-initiated discussion about cannabinoids in the last year. Yet, 48% were concerned about a negative stigma when proposing cannabinoid therapies to patients. While most responders (86%) were willing to prescribe an FDA-approved cannabinoid as a topical treatment, fewer (71%) were willing to prescribe an oral form. 64% of respondents did not know that cannabidiol is not psychoactive and 29% did not know that tetrahydrocannabinol is psychoactive. Limitations: Limited survey population. Conclusions: Dermatology providers are interested in prescribing cannabinoids and patients are speaking about cannabinoids with their dermatologists. However, providersвЂ™ fund of knowledge on this subject is lacking. These results highlight the need for further education and research to detangle the dermatologic benefits and risks of cannabinoids. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(12):1273-1278."

The inflammatory process is a physiological response to a vast number of harmful stimulus that takes place in order to restore homeostasis. Many drugs used in pharmacotherapy are effective to control inflammatory responses, however, there is a range of adverse effects attributed to steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In this sense, herbal medicine and derivatives have gained more attention because of their effectiveness and safety, showing the importance of medicinal plants, especially the Cannabis genus and the cannabinoid derivatives. OBJECTIVE. The aim of this prospection was to identify data related to patents involving Cannabis and cannabinoids for the treatment of inflammation. METHODS.

BACKGROUND. The inflammatory process is a physiological response to a vast number of harmful stimulus that takes place in order to restore homeostasis. Many drugs used in pharmacotherapy are effective to control inflammatory responses, however, there is a range of adverse effects attributed to steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In this sense, herbal medicine and derivatives have gained more attention because of their effectiveness and safety, showing the importance of medicinal plants, especially the Cannabis genus and the cannabinoid derivatives. OBJECTIVE. The aim of this prospection was to identify data related to patents involving Cannabis and cannabinoids for the treatment of inflammation. METHODS.

5036,[!] Inhibition of exocytotic noradrenaline release by presynaptic cannabinoid CB1 receptors on peripheral sympathetic nerves.,8864538,,1996,"1. Activation of CB1 receptors by plant cannabinoids or the endogenous ligand, anandamide, causes hypotension via a sympathoinhibitory action in anaesthetized rats. In mouse isolated vas deferens, activation of CB1 receptors inhibits the electrically evoked twitch response. To determine if these effects are related to presynaptic inhibition of noradrenaline (NA) release, we examined the effects of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 9-THC), anandamide and the CB1 antagonist, SR141716A, on exocytotic NA release in rat isolated atria and vasa deferentia. 2. In isolated atria and vasa deferentia preloaded with [3H]-NA, electrical field stimulation caused [3H]-NA release, which was abolished by tetrodotoxin 0.5 microM and concentration-dependently inhibited by delta 9-THC or anandamide, 0.3-10 microM. The inhibitory effect of delta 9-THC and anandamide was competitively antagonized by SR 141716A, 1-10 microM. 3.

Under LPS stimulation, CBD (1-10 ОјM) potently inhibited the release of prototypical proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-О± and IL-1ОІ) and that of glutamate, a noncytokine mediator of inflammation. The effects of CBD were predominantly receptor-independent and only marginally blunted by blockade of CB2 receptors. We established that CBD inhibited a mechanism involving, sequentially, NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS production and NF-ОєB-dependent signaling events. In line with these observations, active concentrations of CBD demonstrated an intrinsic free-radical scavenging capacity in the cell-free DPPH assay. Of interest, CBD also prevented the rise in glucose uptake observed in microglial cells challenged with LPS, as did the inhibitor of NADPH oxidase apocynin and the inhibitor of IОєB kinase-2, TPCA-1. This indicated that the capacity of CBD to prevent glucose uptake also contributed to its anti-inflammatory activity. Supporting this view, the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) mimicked the antioxidant/immunosuppressive effects of CBD. Interestingly, CBD and 2-DG, as well as apocynin and TPCA-1 caused a reduction in glucose-derived NADPH, a cofactor required for NADPH oxidase activation and ROS generation. These different observations suggest that CBD exerts its anti-inflammatory effects towards microglia through an intrinsic antioxidant effect, which is amplified through inhibition of glucose-dependent NADPH synthesis.

Methods For the extraction of cannabinoids from BALs, a 1 mL sample was added with 300 ВµL of 0.1 N NaOH and 3 mL of hexane/ethyl acetate (9:1). The solvent was then evaporated to dryness. Trimethylsilyl derivatives were prepared and then analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Results The method was linear for the analytes under investigation with coefficients of determination of at least 0.99.

This occurrence let us hypothesize a role of cannabinoids in the development of the disease and prompted an investigation on possible associations between cannabis smoking and clinical outcomes in patients with lung disease and eventually evaluate a cytotoxic effect of cannabinoids themselves."
5104,[!] Vasoconstrictor actions of delta8- and delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol in the rat.,4606,,1976,"Cardiovascular effects of delta8- and delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) were studied after systemic intravenous administration and intra-arterial administration into a perfused vascular bed in the urethane-anesthetized rat. Intravenous administration of delta8- and delta9-THC produced dose-related transient increases in blood pressure followed by more prolonged hypotensive responses and bradycardia. Intra-arterial administration of delta8- and delta9-THC into the perfused hindquarters of the rat produced an increase in perfusion pressure indicative of vasoconstriction. The vasoconstrictor response to the cannabinoids corresponded temporally to a similar response produced by i.a. norepinephrine and was in contrast to the more prolonged vasoconstrictor responses produced by vasopressin. Phentolamine, in a dose which reduced the vasoconstrictor effect of norepinephrine by 90%, significantly reduced the response to i.a. delta9-THC while having no effect on the actions of i.a. vasopressin. It was demonstrated that reserpine pretreatment significantly reduced vasoconstrictor actions of i.a. tyramine and delta9-THC but did not alter the responses to norepinephrine.

5107,[!] Induction of apoptosis by cannabinoids in prostate and colon cancer cells is phosphatase dependent.,22110202,,2011,"OBJECTIVE. We hypothesized that the anticancer activity of cannabinoids was linked to induction of phosphatases. METHODS. The effects of cannabidiol (CBD) and the synthetic cannabinoid WIN-55,212 (WIN) on LNCaP (prostate) and SW480 (colon) cancer cell proliferation were determined by cell counting; apoptosis was determined by cleavage of poly(ADP)ribose polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3 (Western blots); and phosphatase mRNAs were determined by real-time PCR. The role of phosphatases and cannabinoid receptors in mediating CBD- and WIN-induced apoptosis was determined by inhibition and receptor knockdown. RESULTS. CBD and WIN inhibited LNCaP and SW480 cell growth and induced mRNA expression of several phosphatases, and the phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate significantly inhibited cannabinoid-induced PARP cleavage in both cell lines, whereas only CBD-induced apoptosis was CB1 and CB2 receptor-dependent.

Twenty-three healthy controls (HCs) received rs-fMRI and POMS once. RESULTS. Participants with TRE showed average decrease of 71.7% in SF (pвЂЇ<вЂЇ0.0001) and improved CSSS, AEP, and POMS confusion, depression, and fatigue subscores (all pвЂЇ<вЂЇ0.05) on-CBD with POMS scores becoming similar to those of HCs. Paired t-tests showed significant pre-/on-CBD changes in rs-FC in cerebellum, frontal areas, temporal areas, hippocampus, and amygdala with some of them correlating with improvement in behavioral measures. Significant differences in rs-FC between pre-CBD and HCs were found in cerebellum, frontal, and occipital regions. After controlling for changes in SF with CBD, these differences were no longer present when comparing on-CBD to HCs. CONCLUSIONS. This study indicates that highly purified CBD modulates and potentially normalizes rs-FC in the epileptic brain. This effect may underlie its efficacy.

An increasing demand for treatment of cannabis dependence has refueled the discussion about the addictive potential of cannabis. A key feature of all addictive drugs is the ability to increase synaptic dopamine levels in the striatum, a mechanism involved in their rewarding and motivating effects. However, it is currently unknown if cannabis can stimulate striatal dopamine neurotransmission in humans. Here we show that Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component in cannabis, induces dopamine release in the human striatum.

This is consistent with an increase in dopamine levels in these regions. These results suggest that THC shares a potentially addictive property with other drugs of abuse.

The phytocannabinoid-based medicine Sativex-В® is currently marketed for the treatment of spasticity and pain in multiple sclerosis patients and is being investigated for other central and peripheral pathological conditions. It may also serve in Veterinary Medicine for the treatment of domestic animals, in particular for dogs affected by different pathologies, including human-like pathological conditions. With the purpose of assessing different dosing paradigms for using Sativex in Veterinary Medicine, we investigated its pharmacokinetics when administered to naГЇve dogs via sublingual delivery. In the single dose arm of the study, adult Beagle dogs were treated with 3 consecutive sprays of Sativex, and blood samples were collected at 12 intervals up to 24 h later. In the multiple dose arm of the study, Beagle dogs received 3 sprays daily for 14 days, and blood samples were collected for 24 h post final dose. Blood was used to obtain plasma samples and to determine the levels of cannabidiol (CBD), О”-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (О”-9-THC) and its metabolite 11-hydroxy-О”-9-THC. Maximal plasma concentrations of both О”-9-THC (C-max = 18.5 ng/mL) and CBD (C-max = 10.5 ng/mL) were achieved 2 h after administration in the single dose condition and at 1 h in the multiple dose treatment (О”-9-THC: C-max = 24.5 ng/mL; CBD: C-max = 15.2 ng/mL). 11hydroxy-О”-9-THC, which is mainly formed in the liver from О”-9-THC, was almost undetected, which is consistent with the use of sublingual delivery. A potential progressive accumulation of both CBD and О”-9-THC was detected following repeated exposure, with maximum plasma concentrations for both cannabinoids being achieved following multiple dose.

5250,[!] Antiemetics for patients treated with antitumor chemotherapy.,6253100,,1980,"The clinical efficacy of antiemetic drugs was tested in cancer patients who were given a placebo and two antiemetic drugs alone and in combination according to random sequences. The method of investigation allowed assessment of the antiemetic effect and side effects of each drug or combination of drugs using a minimum number of patients. The trial design takes into account carry-over effects and biased selection and is potentially useful in the study of drug side effects.

5253,[!] Characterization of a novel adult murine immortalized microglial cell line and its activation by amyloid-beta.,26819091,,2016,"BACKGROUND. Alzheimer's disease is associated with amyloid-beta (AОІ)-induced microglia activation. This pro-inflammatory response promotes neuronal damage, and therapies are sought to limit microglial activation. Screening efforts to develop new pharmacological inhibitors require a robust in vitro cell system. Current models lack significant responses to AОІ, and their use in examining age-related neurodegenerative diseases is questionable. For example, the commonly used BV-2 microglial line was derived from embryonic mononuclear cells and its activation by various stimuli is limited. To this end, we have established a new immortalized microglial (IMG) cell line from adult murine brain. The objective of this study was to characterize AОІ-induced activation of IMG cells, and here, we demonstrate the ability of cannabinoids to significantly reduce this inflammatory response. METHODS. Microglial cells derived from adult murine brain were immortalized via infection with the v-raf/v-myc retrovirus under conditions that selectively promote microglia growth. The presence or absence of markers CD11b and F4/80 (microglial), NeuN (neuronal), and GFAP (astrocytic) was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy and western blotting. Using IMG and BV-2 cells, levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory transcripts in response to extracellular stimuli were determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Phagocytosis of fluorescent beads and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled AОІ oligomers was assessed using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. FITC-AОІ uptake was quantified using a fluorescence plate reader. The ability of cannabinoids to mitigate AОІ-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was evaluated. RESULTS. IMG cells express the microglial markers CD11b and F4/80 but not NeuN or GFAP. Relative to BV-2 cells, IMG cells increased iNOS (>200-fold) and Arg-1 (>100-fold) in response to pro- and anti-inflammatory stimuli. IMG cells phagocytose foreign particles and AОІ oligomers, with the latter trafficked to phagolysosomes. AОІ-induced activation of IMG cells was suppressed by delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and the CB2-selective agonist JWH-015 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS. IMG cells recapitulate key features of microglial cell activation.

5305,[!] Police documentation of drug use in injured drivers: Implications for monitoring and preventing drug-impaired driving.,29482896,Cannabis; Drugs; Enforcement; Impaired driving; Motor vehicle crashes; Police,2018,"BACKGROUND. Most countries have laws against driving while impaired by drugs. However, in many countries, including Canada and the United States, police must have individualized suspicion that the driver has recently used an impairing substance before they can gather the evidence required for laying a criminal charge. This report studies police documentation of drug involvement among drivers who had a motor-vehicle crash after using an impairing substance. METHODS. We obtained blood samples and police reports on injured drivers treated in participating British Columbia trauma centres following a crash. Blood was analyzed for alcohol, cannabinoids, other recreational drugs, and impairing medications. Corresponding police reports were examined to determine whether police recorded that the driver's ability was impaired by alcohol, drug or medication, or that one of these substances was a possible contributory factor in the crash. RESULTS. We obtained blood samples and corresponding police reports on 1816 injured drivers. Mean driver age was 44 years, 63.2% were male, and 25.8% were admitted to hospital. Alcohol was detected in 272 drivers (15.0%), THC (tetrahydrocannabinol the principal psychoactive ingredient in cannabis) in 136 (7.5%), other recreational drugs in 166 (9.1%), and potentially impairing medications in 363 (20.0%). Police reported that the driver's ability was impaired by alcohol or that alcohol was a possible contributory factor in 64.1% of the crashes involving alcohol-positive drivers. Drug impairment or drugs as a possible contributory factor was reported in 5.9% of the crashes involving THC-positive drivers, and in 16.9% of the crashes involving drivers who tested positive for other recreational drugs. Medication impairment was reported in only 2.2% of the crashes involving medication-positive drivers. CONCLUSIONS. Police seldom document drug involvement in drivers who were in a crash after using cannabis, other recreational drugs or potentially impairing medications.

Baseline HIV RNA level was less than 50 copies/mL for 36 participants (58%), and the median CD4+ cell count was 340 x 109 cells/L. When adjusted for baseline variables, the estimated average effect versus placebo on change in log10 viral load from baseline to day 21 was -0.07 (95% CI, -0.30 to 0.13) for marijuana and -0.04 (CI, -0.20 to 0.14) for dronabinol. The adjusted average changes in viral load in marijuana and dronabinol relative to placebo were -15% (CI, -50% to 34%) and -8% (CI, -37% to 37%), respectively. Neither CD4+ nor CD8+ cell counts appeared to be adversely affected by the cannabinoids. CONCLUSIONS.

5336,[!] Impact of cannabis sativa (marijuana) smoke on alveolar bone loss: a histometric study in rats.,21513470,,2011,"BACKGROUND. Cannabis sativa (marijuana) can interfere with bone physiopathology because of its effect on osteoblast and osteoclast activity. However, its impact on periodontal tissues is still controversial. The present study evaluates whether marijuana smoke affects bone loss (BL) on ligature-induced periodontitis in rats. METHODS. Thirty male Wistar rats were used in the study. A ligature was placed around one of the mandible first molars (ligated teeth) of each animal, and they were then randomly assigned to one of two groups: control (n = 15) or marijuana smoke inhalation ([MSI] for 8 minutes per day; n = 15). Urine samples were obtained to detect the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol. After 30 days, the animals were sacrificed and decalcified sections of the furcation area were obtained and evaluated according to the following histometric parameters: bone area (BA), bone density (BD), and BL. RESULTS. Tetrahydrocannabinol was positive in urine samples only for the rats of the MSI group. Non-significant differences were observed for unligated teeth from both groups regarding BL, BA, and BD (P >0.05). However, intragroup analysis showed that all ligated teeth presented BL and a lower BA and BD compared to unligated teeth (P <0.05).

Acute cannabis administration can produce transient psychotic-like effects in healthy individuals. However, the mechanisms through which this occurs and which factors predict vulnerability remain unclear. We investigate whether cannabis inhalation leads to psychotic-like symptoms and speech illusion; and whether cannabidiol (CBD) blunts such effects (study 1) and adolescence heightens such effects (study 2). METHODS. Two double-blind placebo-controlled studies, assessing speech illusion in a white noise task, and psychotic-like symptoms on the Psychotomimetic States Inventory (PSI). Study 1 compared effects of Cann-CBD (cannabis containing О”-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and negligible levels of CBD) with Cann+CBD (cannabis containing THC and CBD) in 17 adults.

Vaping's popularity has grown exponentially since its introduction to the US market in 2003. Its use has sky-rocketed since the unveiling of the vaping pods in 2017 which may account for the advent of the vaping related illnesses we are now seeing. Substances such as nicotine solution, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) oil, cannabidiol (CBD) oil, and butane hash oil (BHC) packaged in cartridges available in various flavors and concentrations are aerosolized by the heating of metal coils in the e-cigarette/vaping devices. Cases from all over the country have recently been coming to light in which vaping has led to severe acute pulmonary disease or vaping-associated-pulmonary-injury (VAPI). A vast majority of the presenting patients in the reported cases have required hospitalization and intensive care, needing supplemental oxygen and even endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. 98% of patients present with respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, chest pain, cough, hemoptysis), 81% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain), and 100% of patients have constitutional symptoms such as fever, chills, and fatigue/malaise on presentation. Although based on history and clinical presentation it is reasonable to have a high suspicion for VAPI, diagnostic workup to rule out alternative underlying causes such as infection, malignancy, or autoimmune process should be performed before establishing the diagnosis.

Cannabinoids have been identified as direct agonists of TRP channels, including TRPA1 and TRPV1, suggesting that exogenous cannabinoids may influence vagal signaling via TRP channel activation. The diverse therapeutic effects of electrical vagus nerve stimulation also result from administration of the nonpsychotropic cannabinoid, cannabidiol (CBD); however, the direct effects of CBD on vagal afferent signaling remain unknown. We investigated actions of CBD on vagal afferent neurons, using calcium imaging and electrophysiology. CBD produced strong excitatory effects in neurons expressing TRPA1. CBD responses were prevented by removal of bath calcium, ruthenium red, and the TRPA1 antagonist A967079, but not the TRPV1 antagonist SB366791, suggesting an essential role for TRPA1. These pharmacological experiments were confirmed using genetic knockouts where TRPA1 KO mice lacked CBD responses, whereas TRPV1 knockout (KO) mice exhibited CBD-induced activation. We also characterized CBD-provoked inward currents at resting potentials in vagal afferents expressing TRPA1 that were absent in TRPA1 KO mice, but persisted in TRPV1 KO mice. CBD also inhibited voltage-activated sodium conductances in A-fiber, but not in C-fiber afferents. To simulate adaptation, resulting from chronic cannabis use, we administered cannabis extract vapor daily for 3 wk. Cannabis exposure reduced the magnitude of CBD responses, likely due to a loss of TRPA1 signaling.

This study examined the effect of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) on brain activation during a motor inhibition task. METHODS. Functional magnetic resonance imaging and behavioural measures were recorded while 15 healthy volunteers performed a Go/No-Go task following administration of either THC or CBD or placebo in a double-blind, pseudo-randomized, placebo-controlled repeated measures within-subject design. RESULTS. Relative to placebo, THC attenuated activation in the right inferior frontal and the anterior cingulate gyrus. In contrast, CBD deactivated the left temporal cortex and insula. These effects were not related to changes in anxiety, intoxication, sedation, and psychotic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS.

This is a study of occupational exposures to SHCS among law enforcement officers (LEOs) providing security at outdoor concerts on a college campus in a state where adult use of cannabis is legal. Investigators evaluated a convenience sample of LEOs' potential exposure to SHCS and symptoms experienced while providing security during two open-air stadium rock-n-roll concerts on consecutive days in July 2018. During each event, full-shift area and LEO personal air samples were collected for О”9-tetrahydrocannabinol (О”9-THC), the psychoactive component of cannabis. Urine (pre- and postevent; n = 58) and blood (postevent; n = 29) were also collected and analyzed for О”9-THC and two of its metabolites [11-nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid (THC-COOH) and 11-nor-hydroxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (OH-THC)].

Small amounts (<1.0 ng ml-1) of a О”9-THC metabolite (THC-COOH) were found in the postevent urine of 34% of LEOs. Neither О”9-THC nor its metabolites were detected in any blood sample. LEOs reported experiencing non-specific symptoms during the concerts, such as burning, itchy, or red eyes (31%); dry mouth (21%); headache (21%); and coughing (21%). Identification of О”9-THC in the breathing zone for some LEOs indicates the potential for airborne exposure to the psychoactive component of cannabis.

5494,[!] Do Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol concentrations indicate recent use in chronic cannabis users?.,19804462,,2009,"OBJECTIVE. To quantify blood Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentrations in chronic cannabis users over 7 days of continuous monitored abstinence. METHODS. Twenty-five frequent, long-term cannabis users resided on a secure clinical research unit at the US National Institute on Drug Abuse under continuous medical surveillance to prevent cannabis self-administration. METHODS. Whole blood cannabinoid concentrations were determined by two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS. Nine chronic users (36%) had no measurable THC during 7 days of cannabis abstinence; 16 had at least one positive THC > or =0.25 ng/ml, but not necessarily on the first day. On day 7, 6 full days after entering the unit, six participants still displayed detectable THC concentrations [mean +/- standard deviation (SD), 0.3 +/- 0.7 ng/ml] and all 25 had measurable carboxy-metabolite (6.2 +/- 8.8 ng/ml). The highest observed THC concentrations on admission (day 1) and day 7 were 7.0 and 3.0 ng/ml, respectively. Interestingly, five participants, all female, had THC-positive whole blood specimens over all 7 days. Body mass index did not correlate with time until the last THC-positive specimen (n = 16; r = -0.2; P = 0.445). CONCLUSIONS. Substantial whole blood THC concentrations persist multiple days after drug discontinuation in heavy chronic cannabis users. It is currently unknown whether neurocognitive impairment occurs with low blood THC concentrations, and whether return to normal performance, as documented previously following extended cannabis abstinence, is accompanied by the removal of residual THC in brain.

We tested the hypotheses that renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a contributing factor to polarization of ILCs and that glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) and cannabidiol regulate them in this condition. Mice subjected to unilateral renal IRI were treated with the following agents before restoration of renal blood flow: cannabidiol, DMSO, transactivator of transcription- (TAT-) GILZ, or the TAT peptide. Thereafter, kidney cells were prepared for flow cytometry analyses. Sham kidneys treated with either cannabidiol or TAT-GILZ displayed similar frequencies of each subset of ILCs compared to DMSO or TAT, respectively.

Extracts from the cannabis plant can dramatically improve the health of children suffering from refractory epilepsies such as Dravet syndrome. These extracts typically contain cannabidiol (CBD), a phytocannabinoid with well-documented anticonvulsant effects, but may also contain О”-9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (О”-9 -THC). It is unclear whether the presence of О”-9 -THC modulates the anticonvulsant efficacy of CBD. Here, we utilized the Scn1a-+/- mouse model of Dravet syndrome to examine this question. METHODS. Scn1a-+/- mice recapitulate core features of Dravet syndrome, including hyperthermia-induced seizures, early onset spontaneous seizures and sudden death. We assessed the effects on CBD and О”-9 -THC alone, and in combination on hyperthermia-induced seizures, spontaneous seizures and premature mortality. RESULTS. Administered alone, CBD (100 mgВ·kg--1 i.p.) was anticonvulsant against hyperthermia-induced seizures as were low (0.1 and 0.3 mgВ·kg--1 i.p.) but not higher doses of О”-9 -THC.

Samples (200 ВµL) were extracted through protein precipitation and separated with a Kinetex EVO C18 column and a 65%-95% gradient of methanol and 0.2% ammonium hydroxide/H2O at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. Samples were obtained from patients with epilepsy receiving cannabis for the treatment of seizures. The extracted lower limit of quantification was 0.05 ng/mL for CBD, cannabidivarin, cannabinol, and 11-OH-THC; 0.10 ng/mL for cannabidiolic acid, cannabigerol, cannabichromene, cannabigerolic acid, THC, THCA, and THCV; and 0.50 ng/mL for THC-COOH and THC-COOH-glu. Mean quality control intraday accuracy and precision for all analytes ranged 96.5%-104% and 2.7%-4.9%, respectively, whereas interday accuracy and precision ranged 98%-103.3% and 0.2%-3.6%, respectively.

A sensitive, robust method was developed and validated to quantitate 13 major natural cannabinoid parent and metabolite compounds in human plasma at or below 0.5 ng/mL. A liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated to measure 13 cannabinoid compounds: cannabidiol (CBD), cannabidiolic acid, cannabidivarin, cannabinol, cannabigerol, cannabigerolic acid, cannabichromene, О”-tetrahydocannabinol (THC), О”-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid A (THCA), О”-tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), 11-hydroxy-О”-tetrahydrocannbinol (11-OH-THC), 11-nor-9-carboxy-О”-tetrahydrocannbinol (THC-COOH), and 11-nor-9-carboxy-О”-tetrahydrocannabinol glucuronide (THC-COOH-glu). Samples (200 ВµL) were extracted through protein precipitation and separated with a Kinetex EVO C18 column and a 65%-95% gradient of methanol and 0.2% ammonium hydroxide/H2O at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. Samples were obtained from patients with epilepsy receiving cannabis for the treatment of seizures. The extracted lower limit of quantification was 0.05 ng/mL for CBD, cannabidivarin, cannabinol, and 11-OH-THC; 0.10 ng/mL for cannabidiolic acid, cannabigerol, cannabichromene, cannabigerolic acid, THC, THCA, and THCV; and 0.50 ng/mL for THC-COOH and THC-COOH-glu. Mean quality control intraday accuracy and precision for all analytes ranged 96.5%-104% and 2.7%-4.9%, respectively, whereas interday accuracy and precision ranged 98%-103.3% and 0.2%-3.6%, respectively.

Inhibition by cannabinoid compounds was neither synergistic nor additive with muscarinic or alpha-adrenergic agents when each was present at maximally inhibitory concentrations. Cannabinoid inhibition was not blocked by atropine, yohimbine, or naloxone, suggesting that muscarinic, alpha 2-adrenergic and certain opiate receptors may not be required for the response. The inhibition of adenylate cyclase was specific for psychoactive cannabinoids, since cannabinol and cannabidiol produced minimal or no response. Inhibition was also stereoselective, since dextronantradol did not produce the response. A biphasic log dose-response curve was observed for each of the cannabinoid drugs, such that reversal of the inhibition occurred at 3-10 microM. Possible mechanisms for the effects of cannabinoid drugs on adenylate cyclase activity are discussed."

No controlled studies have investigated the use of cannabidiol for patients with seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. We therefore assessed the efficacy and safety of cannabidiol as an add-on anticonvulsant therapy in this population of patients. In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial done at 24 clinical sites in the USA, the Netherlands, and Poland, we investigated the efficacy of cannabidiol as add-on therapy for drop seizures in patients with treatment-resistant Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Eligible patients (aged 2-55 years) had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, including a history of slow (<3 Hz) spike-and-wave patterns on electroencephalogram, evidence of more than one type of generalised seizure for at least 6 months, at least two drop seizures per week during the 4-week baseline period, and had not responded to treatment with at least two antiepileptic drugs. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive voice response system, stratified by age group, to receive 20 mg/kg oral cannabidiol daily or matched placebo for 14 weeks. All patients, caregivers, investigators, and individuals assessing data were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was percentage change from baseline in monthly frequency of drop seizures during the treatment period, analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had post-baseline efficacy data. All randomly assigned patients were included in the safety analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02224690. Between April 28, 2015, and Oct 15, 2015, we randomly assigned 171 patients to receive cannabidiol (n=86) or placebo (n=85). 14 patients in the cannabidiol group and one in the placebo group discontinued study treatment; all randomly assigned patients received at least one dose of study treatment and had post-baseline efficacy data. The median percentage reduction in monthly drop seizure frequency from baseline was 43В·9% (IQR -69В·6 to -1В·9) in the cannibidiol group and 21В·8% (IQR -45В·7 to 1В·7) in the placebo group. The estimated median difference between the treatment groups was -17В·21 (95% CI -30В·32 to -4В·09; p=0В·0135) during the 14-week treatment period. Adverse events occurred in 74 (86%) of 86 patients in the cannabidiol group and 59 (69%) of 85 patients in the placebo group; most were mild or moderate. The most common adverse events were diarrhoea, somnolence, pyrexia, decreased appetite, and vomiting. 12 (14%) patients in the cannabidiol group and one (1%) patient in the placebo group withdrew from the study because of adverse events. One patient (1%) died in the cannabidiol group, but this was considered unrelated to treatment. Add-on cannabidiol is efficacious for the treatment of patients with drop seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and is generally well tolerated.

In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial done at 24 clinical sites in the USA, the Netherlands, and Poland, we investigated the efficacy of cannabidiol as add-on therapy for drop seizures in patients with treatment-resistant Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Eligible patients (aged 2-55 years) had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, including a history of slow (<3 Hz) spike-and-wave patterns on electroencephalogram, evidence of more than one type of generalised seizure for at least 6 months, at least two drop seizures per week during the 4-week baseline period, and had not responded to treatment with at least two antiepileptic drugs. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive voice response system, stratified by age group, to receive 20 mg/kg oral cannabidiol daily or matched placebo for 14 weeks. All patients, caregivers, investigators, and individuals assessing data were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was percentage change from baseline in monthly frequency of drop seizures during the treatment period, analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had post-baseline efficacy data. All randomly assigned patients were included in the safety analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02224690. Between April 28, 2015, and Oct 15, 2015, we randomly assigned 171 patients to receive cannabidiol (n=86) or placebo (n=85). 14 patients in the cannabidiol group and one in the placebo group discontinued study treatment; all randomly assigned patients received at least one dose of study treatment and had post-baseline efficacy data. The median percentage reduction in monthly drop seizure frequency from baseline was 43В·9% (IQR -69В·6 to -1В·9) in the cannibidiol group and 21В·8% (IQR -45В·7 to 1В·7) in the placebo group. The estimated median difference between the treatment groups was -17В·21 (95% CI -30В·32 to -4В·09; p=0В·0135) during the 14-week treatment period. Adverse events occurred in 74 (86%) of 86 patients in the cannabidiol group and 59 (69%) of 85 patients in the placebo group; most were mild or moderate. The most common adverse events were diarrhoea, somnolence, pyrexia, decreased appetite, and vomiting. 12 (14%) patients in the cannabidiol group and one (1%) patient in the placebo group withdrew from the study because of adverse events. One patient (1%) died in the cannabidiol group, but this was considered unrelated to treatment.

5754,[!] Balanced placebo design with marijuana: pharmacological and expectancy effects on impulsivity and risk taking.,22588253,,2012,"BACKGROUND. Marijuana is believed to increase impulsivity and risk taking, but the processes whereby it affects such behaviors are not understood. Indeed, either the pharmacologic effect of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or the expectancy of receiving it may lead to deficits in cognitive processing and increases in risk taking. OBJECTIVE. We examined the relative effects of expecting to receive active marijuana and the pharmacological drug effects using a balanced placebo design. Young adult regular marijuana users (NвЂ‰=вЂ‰136) were randomly assigned into one of four groups in a two Г— two instructional set (Told THC vs. Told no THC) by drug administration (smoked marijuana with 2.8 % THC vs. placebo) design. Dependent measures included subjective intoxication, behavioral impulsivity, and decision-making related to risky behaviors. RESULTS. Active THC, regardless of expectancy, impaired inhibition on the Stop Signal and Stroop Color-Word tasks. Expectancy of having smoked THC, regardless of active drug, decreased impulsive decision-making on a delay discounting task among participants reporting no deception and increased perception of sexual risk among women, consistent with a compensatory effect. Expectancy of smoking THC in combination with active THC increased negative perceptions from risky alcohol use. Active drug and expectancy independently increased subjective intoxication. CONCLUSIONS. Results highlight the importance of marijuana expectancy effects as users believing they are smoking marijuana may compensate for expected intoxication effects when engaged in deliberate decision-making by making less impulsive and risky decisions.

Effects of marijuana on impulsive disinhibition, by contrast, reflect direct pharmacologic effects for which participants did not compensate."

This paper describes the use of the single patient therapy plan (SPTP). The SPTP has been designed to assess the efficacy at an individual level of a commercially available cannabinoid product, cannabidiol, in reducing seizure frequency in paediatric patients with intractable epilepsy. METHODS. The SPTP is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled N-of-1 trial designed to assess the efficacy of treatment in a neurology outpatient setting. The primary objective of the SPTP is to assess the efficacy of cannabidiol in reducing seizure frequency in each patient with intractable epilepsy, with change in seizure frequency being the primary outcome of interest. The analysis adopts a Bayesian approach, which provides results in the form of posterior probabilities that various levels of benefit (based on the primary outcome measure, seizure frequency) have been achieved under active treatment compared to placebo, accompanied by decision rules that provide thresholds for deciding whether treatment has been successful in the individual patient. The SPTP arrangement is most accurately considered part of clinical practice rather than research, since it is aimed at making clinical treatment decisions for individual patients and is not testing a hypothesis or collecting aggregate data. Therefore, Human Research Ethics Committee approval was considered not to be required, although it is recommended that hospital Clinical Ethics Committees provide ethical oversight. CONCLUSIONS.

The identified manuscripts were analyzed with VOSviewer for further bibliometric parameters, such as citation analysis of institutions, countries/regions, and journals, and to visualize the citation patterns of the terms appearing in the titles and abstracts. Results: The literature search resulted in 43,354 manuscripts. Nearly 98% of them were published since the 1990s.

5816,[!] The plant cannabinoid Delta9-tetrahydrocannabivarin can decrease signs of inflammation and inflammatory pain in mice.,20590571,,2010,"OBJECTIVE. The phytocannabinoid, Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), can block cannabinoid CB(1) receptors. This investigation explored its ability to activate CB(2) receptors, there being evidence that combined CB(2) activation/CB(1) blockade would ameliorate certain disorders. METHODS. We tested the ability of THCV to activate CB(2) receptors by determining whether: (i) it inhibited forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with human CB(2) (hCB(2)) receptors; (ii) it stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding to hCB(2) CHO cell and mouse spleen membranes; (iii) it attenuated signs of inflammation/hyperalgesia induced in mouse hind paws by intraplantar injection of carrageenan or formalin; and (iv) any such anti-inflammatory or anti-hyperalgesic effects were blocked by a CB(1) or CB(2) receptor antagonist. RESULTS. THCV inhibited cyclic AMP production by hCB(2) CHO cells (EC(50)= 38 nM), but not by hCB(1) or untransfected CHO cells or by hCB(2) CHO cells pre-incubated with pertussis toxin (100 ng.mL(-1)) and stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding to hCB(2) CHO and mouse spleen membranes. THCV (0.3 or 1 mg.kg(-1) i.p.) decreased carrageenan-induced oedema in a manner that seemed to be CB(2) receptor-mediated and suppressed carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia. THCV (i.p.) also decreased pain behaviour in phase 2 of the formalin test at 1 mg.kg(-1), and in both phases of this test at 5 mg.kg(-1); these effects of THCV appeared to be CB(1) and CB(2) receptor mediated.

We tested the ability of THCV to activate CB(2) receptors by determining whether: (i) it inhibited forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with human CB(2) (hCB(2)) receptors; (ii) it stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding to hCB(2) CHO cell and mouse spleen membranes; (iii) it attenuated signs of inflammation/hyperalgesia induced in mouse hind paws by intraplantar injection of carrageenan or formalin; and (iv) any such anti-inflammatory or anti-hyperalgesic effects were blocked by a CB(1) or CB(2) receptor antagonist. RESULTS. THCV inhibited cyclic AMP production by hCB(2) CHO cells (EC(50)= 38 nM), but not by hCB(1) or untransfected CHO cells or by hCB(2) CHO cells pre-incubated with pertussis toxin (100 ng.mL(-1)) and stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding to hCB(2) CHO and mouse spleen membranes. THCV (0.3 or 1 mg.kg(-1) i.p.) decreased carrageenan-induced oedema in a manner that seemed to be CB(2) receptor-mediated and suppressed carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia. THCV (i.p.) also decreased pain behaviour in phase 2 of the formalin test at 1 mg.kg(-1), and in both phases of this test at 5 mg.kg(-1); these effects of THCV appeared to be CB(1) and CB(2) receptor mediated. CONCLUSIONS. THCV can activate CB(2) receptors in vitro and decrease signs of inflammation and inflammatory pain in mice partly via CB(1) and/or CB(2) receptor activation."

Previous research has demonstrated that the chronic use of methamphetamine (METH) induces long-term cognitive impairment and cannabidiol (CBD), as a neuroprotectant, can reverse spatial memory deficits induced by drug abuse. The study aimed to evaluate the effect of CBD on METH-induced memory impairment in rats chronically exposed to METH (CEM). For the induction of CEM, animals received METH (2вЂ‰mg/kg, twice/day) for 10вЂ‰days. Thereafter, the effect of intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of CBD (32 and 160вЂ‰nmol) during the (10вЂ‰days) abstinence period on spatial memory was evaluated using the Y-Maze test, while recognition memory was examined using the novel object recognition (NOR) test. The results revealed a significant increase in the motor activity of METH-treated animals compared with the control group and, after the 10-day abstinence period, motor activity returned to baseline. Notably, the chronic administration of METH had impairing effects on spontaneous alternation performance and recognition memory, which was clearly observed in the NOR test. Additionally, although the ICV administration of CBD (160вЂ‰nmol) could reverse long-term memory, a lower dose (32вЂ‰nmol) did not result in any significant increase in exploring the novel object during short-term memory testing.

Its growing acceptance and legalization have markedly increased the risks of child psychopathology, including psychotic-like experiences, which lowers the age of onset for a first psychotic episode. As the majority of patients with schizophrenia go through a premorbid condition long before this occurs, understanding neurobiological underpinnings of the prodromal stage of the disease is critical to improving illness trajectories and therapeutic outcomes. We have previously shown that male rat offspring prenatally exposed to О”-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a rat model of prenatal cannabinoid exposure (PCE), exhibit extensive molecular and synaptic changes in dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), converging on a hyperdopaminergic state. This leads to a silent psychotic-like endophenotype that is unmasked by a single exposure to THC. Here, we further characterized the VTA dopamine neuron and sensorimotor gating functions of PCE rats exposed to acute stress or a challenge of the D2 receptor agonist apomorphine, by using in vivo single-unit extracellular recordings and Prepulse Inhibition (PPI) analyses. At pre-puberty, PCE male rat offspring display a reduced population activity of VTA dopamine neurons in vivo, the majority of which are tonically active. PCE male progeny also exhibit enhanced sensitivity to dopamine D2 (DAD2) receptor activation and a vulnerability to acute stress, which is associated with compromised sensorimotor gating functions.

As the majority of patients with schizophrenia go through a premorbid condition long before this occurs, understanding neurobiological underpinnings of the prodromal stage of the disease is critical to improving illness trajectories and therapeutic outcomes. We have previously shown that male rat offspring prenatally exposed to О”-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a rat model of prenatal cannabinoid exposure (PCE), exhibit extensive molecular and synaptic changes in dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), converging on a hyperdopaminergic state. This leads to a silent psychotic-like endophenotype that is unmasked by a single exposure to THC. Here, we further characterized the VTA dopamine neuron and sensorimotor gating functions of PCE rats exposed to acute stress or a challenge of the D2 receptor agonist apomorphine, by using in vivo single-unit extracellular recordings and Prepulse Inhibition (PPI) analyses. At pre-puberty, PCE male rat offspring display a reduced population activity of VTA dopamine neurons in vivo, the majority of which are tonically active. PCE male progeny also exhibit enhanced sensitivity to dopamine D2 (DAD2) receptor activation and a vulnerability to acute stress, which is associated with compromised sensorimotor gating functions. This data extends our knowledge of the multifaceted sequelae imposed by PCE in the mesolimbic dopamine system of male pre-adolescent rats, which renders a neural substrate highly susceptible to subsequent challenges that may trigger psychotic-like outcomes."
5866,[!] Two cases of sudden sensorineural hearing loss after methadone overdose.,20028962,,2010,"OBJECTIVE. To document the presentation of 2 cases of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL) following methadone overdose. METHODS. We report 2 cases of acute, bilateral methadone-induced hearing loss that took place on the same night in our emergency department. A 30-year-old male and his 25-year-old wife were found unresponsive in their home after ingesting an unknown, but presumably large, quantity of methadone. Drugs that are typically categorized as ototoxic were ruled out in each patient via rapid in-house urine drug screens as well with a comprehensive analysis via gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Methadone and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) were the only drugs found in the toxicology screenings that were common to both patients. The man had a long treatment course that included several days in the intensive care unit. The woman recovered completely and was discharged within a day of admission. The hearing loss in both patients reversed completely within 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS. Several medications are commonly associated with ototoxicity, including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, antibiotics, loop diuretics, and chemotherapy agents. Although rare, drug-induced SSHL has been documented particularly among intravenous drug abusers after heroin injection. Until now, there has been only one published case report documenting drug-induced SSHL attributed to methadone. CONCLUSIONS. We believe methadone to be the probable cause of SSHL in both patients, because it and THC were the only common drugs found on toxicology screens, a recent case report involved methadone-induced SSHL, and because of the suddenness of the onset and recovery of the patient's hearing coinciding with the time frame of the ingestion.

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of Cannabis sativa extract in the working memory version of the Morris water maze (MWM; Morris, 1984[43]) test and determine the effect of standard memory enhancing drugs. Cannabis sativa was given at doses of 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg (expressed as О”(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol) alone or co-administered with donepezil (1 mg/kg), piracetam (150 mg/ kg), vinpocetine (1.5 mg/kg) or ginkgo biloba (25 mg/kg) once daily subcutaneously (s.c.) for one month. Mice were examined three times weekly for their ability to locate a submerged platform. Mice were euthanized 30 days after starting cannabis injection when biochemical assays were carried out. Malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), nitric oxide, glucose and brain monoamines were determined. Cannabis resulted in a significant increase in the time taken to locate the platform and enhanced the memory impairment produced by scopolamine. This effect of cannabis decreased by memory enhancing drugs with piracetam resulting in the most-shorter latency compared with the cannabis. Biochemically, cannabis altered the oxidative status of the brain with decreased MDA, increased GSH, but decreased nitric oxide and glucose. In cannabis-treated rats, the level of GSH in brain was increased after vinpocetine and donepezil and was markedly elevated after Ginkgo biloba. Piracetam restored the decrease in glucose and nitric oxide by cannabis. Cannabis caused dose-dependent increases of brain serotonin, noradrenaline and dopamine. After cannabis treatment, noradrenaline is restored to its normal value by donepezil, vinpocetine or Ginkgo biloba, but increased by piracetam.

Experimental Approach: Sex and strain responses relative to baseline were quantified following daily exposure (i.p.) to 10вЂ‰mg/kg THC or vehicle (VEH) over the course of 5 days. Dependent measures included hypothermia (decreased body temperature) and ataxia (decreased spontaneous activity in the open field), and antinociception (increase in tail withdrawal latency to a thermal stimulus). Initial sensitivity to THC was defined as the difference in response between baseline and day 1. Rapid tolerance to THC was defined as the difference in response between days 1 and 2. Results: B6 exhibited greater THC-induced motor activity suppression and initial sensitivity to ataxia relative to the D2 strain. Females demonstrated greater levels of THC-induced hypothermia and initial sensitivity relative to males. Higher levels of THC-induced antinociception and initial sensitivity were observed for D2 relative to B6. Rapid tolerance to THC was observed for hypothermia and antinociception.

Dravet syndrome is a severe, genetic form of paediatric epilepsy associated with premature mortality and co-morbidities such as anxiety, depression, autism, motor dysfunction and memory deficits. Cannabidiol is an approved anticonvulsive drug in the United States and Europe for seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients 2 years of age and older. We investigated its potential to prevent premature mortality and improve associated co-morbidities. METHODS. The efficacy of sub-chronic cannabidiol administration in two mouse models of Dravet syndrome was investigated. The effect of cannabidiol on neonatal welfare and survival was studied using Scn1a--/- mice. We then used a hybrid, heterozygote Scn1a-+/- mouse model to study the effect of cannabidiol on survival and behavioural co-morbidities: motor deficits (rotarod and static-beam test), gait abnormality (gait test), social anxiety (social interaction test), anxiety-like (elevated plus maze) and depressive-like behaviours (sucrose preference test) and cognitive impairment (radial arm maze test). RESULTS. In Scn1a--/- mice, cannabidiol increased survival and delayed worsening of neonatal welfare. In Scn1a-+/- mice, chronic cannabidiol administration did not show any adverse effect on motor function and gait, reduced premature mortality, improved social behaviour and memory function, and reduced anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviours.

An increase in the potency of the cannabis cigarettes has been observed over the past three decades. OBJECTIVE. In this study, we aimed to establish the impact of О”9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on the rating of subjective effects (intensity and duration of the effects), up to 23 % THC potency (69 mg THC) among recreational users. METHODS. Recreational users (N = 24) smoked cannabis cigarettes with four doses of THC (placebo 29, 49 and 69 mg of THC) on four separate test days in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. The participants filled in three different questionnaires measuring subjective effects during the exposure up to 8 h post-smoking. The 'high' feeling, heart rate, blood pressure and THC serum concentrations were also regularly recorded during these 8 h. RESULTS. THC significantly increased the high feeling, dizziness, dry-mouthed feeling, palpitations, impaired memory and concentration, and 'down', 'sedated' and 'anxious' feelings. In addition, THC significantly decreased alertness, contentment and calmness. A cubic relationship was observed between 'feeling the drug' and 'wanting more'. The THC-induced decrease in 'feeling stimulated' and increase in anxiety lasted up to 8 h post-smoking.

BACKGROUND. An increase in the potency of the cannabis cigarettes has been observed over the past three decades. OBJECTIVE. In this study, we aimed to establish the impact of О”9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on the rating of subjective effects (intensity and duration of the effects), up to 23 % THC potency (69 mg THC) among recreational users. METHODS. Recreational users (N = 24) smoked cannabis cigarettes with four doses of THC (placebo 29, 49 and 69 mg of THC) on four separate test days in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. The participants filled in three different questionnaires measuring subjective effects during the exposure up to 8 h post-smoking. The 'high' feeling, heart rate, blood pressure and THC serum concentrations were also regularly recorded during these 8 h. RESULTS. THC significantly increased the high feeling, dizziness, dry-mouthed feeling, palpitations, impaired memory and concentration, and 'down', 'sedated' and 'anxious' feelings. In addition, THC significantly decreased alertness, contentment and calmness. A cubic relationship was observed between 'feeling the drug' and 'wanting more'. The THC-induced decrease in 'feeling stimulated' and increase in anxiety lasted up to 8 h post-smoking. Sedation at 8 h post-smoking was increased by a factor of 5.7 with the highest THC dose, compared to the placebo. CONCLUSIONS.

6033,[!] Severe toxicity following synthetic cannabinoid ingestion.,21970775,,2011,"OBJECTIVE. To report a case of seizures and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) following confirmed synthetic cannabinoid ingestion. BACKGROUND. Despite widespread use of legal synthetic cannabinoids, reports of serious toxicity following confirmed use of synthetic cannabinoids are rare. We report severe toxicity including seizures following intentional ingestion of the synthetic cannabinoid JWH-018 and detail confirmation by laboratory analysis. METHODS. A healthy 48 year old man had a generalized seizure within thirty minutes of ingesting an ethanol mixture containing a white powder he purchased from the Internet in an attempt to get high. Seizures recurred and abated with lorazepam. Initial vital signs were: pulse, 106/min; BP, 140/88 mmHg; respirations, 22/min; temperature, 37.7 В°C. A noncontrast computed tomography of the brain and EEG were negative, and serum chemistry values were normal. The blood ethanol concentration was 3.8 mg/dL and the CPK 2,649 U/L. Urine drug screening by EMIT was negative for common drugs of abuse, including tetrahydrocannabinol. On hospital day 1, he developed medically refractory SVT. The patient had no further complications and was discharged in his normal state of health 10 days after admission. The original powder was confirmed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry to be JWH-018, and a primary JWH-018 metabolite was detected in the patient's urine (200 nM) using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. CONCLUSIONS. Synthetic cannabinoids are legal in many parts of the world and easily obtained over the Internet. Data on human toxicity are limited and real-time confirmatory testing is unavailable to clinicians. The potential for toxicity exists for users mistakenly associating the dose and side effect profiles of synthetic cannabinoids to those of marijuana. CONCLUSIONS.

The efficacy of cannabidiol (CBD) with and without concomitant clobazam (CLB) was evaluated in stratified analyses of four large randomized controlled trials, two in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and two in Dravet syndrome. METHODS. Each trial of CBD (Epidiolex-В® in the US; Epidyolex-В® in the EU; 10 and 20В mg/kg/day) was evaluated by CLB use. The treatment ratio was analyzed using negative binomial regression for changes in seizure frequency and logistic regression for the 50% responder rate, where the principle analysis combined both indications and CBD doses in a stratified meta-analysis. Pharmacokinetic data were examined for an exposure/response relationship based on CLB presence/absence. Safety data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS. The meta-analysis favored CBD vs. placebo regardless of CLB use. The treatment ratio (95% CI) of CBD over placebo for the average reduction in seizure frequency was 0.59 (0.52, 0.68; PВ <В .0001) with CLB and 0.85 (0.73, 0.98; PВ =В .0226) without CLB, and the 50% responder rate odds ratio (95% CI) was 2.51 (1.69, 3.71; PВ <В .0001) with CLB and 2.40 (1.38, 4.16; PВ =В .0020) without CLB. Adverse events (AEs) related to somnolence, rash, pneumonia, or aggression were more common in patients with concomitant CLB.

6072,[!] Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol-induced cognitive deficits are reversed by olanzapine but not haloperidol in rats.,18029074,,2008,"Cannabis is the most widely used illicit substance. Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive component of cannabis, is known to induce cognitive impairment that closely resembles the impairment observed in schizophrenic patients. THC has also been known to impair spatial memory in rats tested in the eight-arm radial maze. We previously reported that microinjection of THC (20 microg/side) into the rat dorsal hippocampus impaired spatial memory and that i.p. injection of THC (6 mg/kg) decreased the extracellular levels of acetylcholine (ACh) in the dorsal hippocampus. In the present study, we compared the effects of olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, with those of haloperidol, a typical neuroleptic, on the impairments of spatial memory and decreased ACh levels induced by THC (6 mg/kg, i.p.) in rats.

There is increasing interest in the relationship between cannabinoids and psychosis. While individual human laboratory studies have been critical in demonstrating that cannabinoids (e.g., delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC]) can induce acute transient psychosis-like effects in healthy human volunteers, combining data from multiple studies offers a fine-grained view of these effects. METHODS. THC-induced psychosis-relevant effects were examined using a data repository of 10 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover studies with 400 i.v. THC infusions in healthy human volunteers. The Positive and Negative Syndrome scale was used to measure psychotomimetic effects. The profile of symptoms, frequency of a response, its relationship to THC dose and substance use, latent structure in Positive and Negative Syndrome scale response, and the relationships between psychotomimetic and perceptual alteration symptoms were evaluated. RESULTS. Clinically meaningful increases in positive symptoms were noted in 44.75% infusions; conceptual disorganization, hallucinations, blunted affect, somatic concern, motor retardation, and poor attention were the items most frequently altered by THC.

We conducted a pilot randomized, parallel arm, double-blind study in 10 healthy adults to determine differences in pharmacokinetics of commercially available water and lipid-soluble CBD powders. Participants consumed a single 30вЂ‰mg dose, which is within the range of typical commercial supplement doses, and blood samples were collected over 6вЂ‰hr and analyzed for CBD concentrations. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected at baseline and T = 90вЂ‰min, cultured and stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce an inflammatory response. Cell supernatants were assayed for IL-10 and TNF, markers of inflammation, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The water-soluble powder had C-max = 2.82вЂ‰ng/ml, T-max = 90вЂ‰min, and was approximately Г—4.5 more bioavailable than the lipid-soluble form. TNF was decreased in LPS-stimulated PBMCs collected 90вЂ‰min after CBD exposure relative to cells collected at baseline. This study provides pilot data for designing and powering future studies to establish the anti-inflammatory potential and bioavailability of a larger variety of commercial CBD products consumed by humans."

The use of cannabis with higher О”9-tetrahydrocannabinol content has been associated with greater risk, and earlier onset, of psychosis.

Here, we investigated whether cannabis potency and pattern of use are associated with changes in corpus callosum (CC) microstructural organization, in patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) and individuals without psychosis, cannabis users and non-users. METHODS. The CC of 56 FEP (37 cannabis users) and 43 individuals without psychosis (22 cannabis users) was virtually dissected and segmented using diffusion tensor imaging tractography. The diffusion index of fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity was calculated for each segment. RESULTS. Across the whole sample, users of high-potency cannabis had higher total CC MD and higher total CC AD than both low-potency users and those who never used (p = 0.005 and p = 0.004, respectively). Daily users also had higher total CC MD and higher total CC AD than both occasional users and those who never used (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively).

However, there was no effect of group (patient/individuals without psychosis) or group x potency interaction for either potency or frequency of use. The within-group analysis showed in fact that the effects of potency and frequency were similar in FEP users and in users without psychosis. CONCLUSIONS. Frequent use of high-potency cannabis is associated with disturbed callosal microstructural organization in individuals with and without psychosis. Since high-potency preparations are now replacing traditional herbal drugs in many European countries, raising awareness about the risks of high-potency cannabis is crucial."

6229,[!] Downregulation of rat brain cannabinoid binding sites after chronic delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol treatment.,8115426,,1994,"Specific cannabinoid receptors have been recently described in extrapyramidal and limbic areas and presumably might mediate the effects of marijuana exposure on behavioral processes related to those areas. In this work, we examined whether cannabinoid receptors exhibit downregulation as a consequence of the chronic exposure to delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which might explain certain tolerance phenomena observed in relation to motor and limbic effects of marijuana. To this end, we first characterized the binding of cannabinoid receptors, by using [3H]CP-55,940 binding assays, in the striatum, limbic forebrain, and ventral mesencephalon of male rats, and, second, we measured the density and affinity of those receptors in these brain areas after 7 days of a daily treatment with THC. Development of a tolerance phenomenon was behaviorally tested by using an open-field technique. Results were as follows. The three areas studies presented specific and saturable binding for the cannabinoid ligand, as revealed by their corresponding association and dissociation curves, displacement by THC, saturation curves, and Scatchard plots. A chronic treatment with THC produced the expected tolerance phenomenon: The decrease caused by an acute dose in spontaneous locomotor (49.4%) and exploratory (59.7%) activities and, mainly, the increase in the time spent by the rat in inactivity (181.7%) were diminished after 7 days of daily treatment (39.4, 40.4, and 31.7%, respectively).

This first in human study consisted of two parts. Panel I included healthy males and females (n = 6/6) in a double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, crossover study with sublingual (crushed tablet) and oral administration of NamisolВ® (5 mg THC). Based on these results, male and female (n = 4/5) participants from panel I received oral THC 6.5 and 8.0 mg or matching placebo in a randomized, crossover, rising dose study during panel II. PD measurements were body sway; visual analogue scales (VAS) mood, psychedelic and heart rate. THC and 11-OH-THC population PK analysis was performed. RESULTS. Sublingual administration showed a flat concentration profile compared with oral administration. Oral THC apparent t(1/2) was 72-80 min, t(max) was 39-56 min and C(max) 2.92-4.69 ng ml(-1) .

In this study, we hypothesized that level of cannabis smoked by participants in our treatment study would be inversely related to the level of threat-related amygdala reactivity. Subjects were recruited from among participants in our double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of fluoxetine in comorbid youth with cannabis dependence/major depression. The threat-related amygdala reactivity task used by Hariri et al. (2009) was completed during BOLD fMRI scans at study baseline and then again 12 weeks later at the end of the trial. Data are available from six subjects with pre-and post-treatment fMRI data. During the course of the study, five of the six subjects demonstrated a decrease in their level of cannabis use, with a mean decrease of 64%, and those persons all demonstrated an increase in their level of amygdala reactivity. One subject demonstrated an increase in their level of cannabis use (a 79% increase) during the treatment trial, and that person demonstrated a decrease in their level of amygdala reactivity.

The tetrahydrocannabinols are among the most potent hypothermic agents known. A comparison of the hypothermic action of delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta9-THC) with chlorpromazine (CPZ) and morphine shows the following order of hypothermic potency: CPZ greater than delta9-THC greater than morphine. A marked depression of oxygen consumption is produced by delta9-THC both in vivo and in the isolated perfused liver preparation. Simultaneous measurement of core temperature and tail temperature after delta9-THC shows that tail temperature is decreased more by delta9-THC than it is in animals that attain comparable core hypothermia without drug treatment.

A 58-year-old female with a history of bilateral breast carcinoma in remission, was treated with tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention for over 6 years. CBD was instituted to treat persistent postsurgical pain, inadequately managed by alternate analgesics. It was postulated that CBD may diminish tamoxifen metabolism by CYP3A4 and 2D6 to form active metabolite endoxifen, which exerts the anticancer benefits.

6346,[!] Cannabis and Alcohol Abuse Among First Psychotic Episode Inpatients.,28492376,,2016,"BACKGROUND. Psychoactive substance abuse, which includes abuse of alcohol and street drugs, is common among first-episode psychosis patients, but the prevalence of cannabis abuse is particularly high. However, there have been very few reported studies concerning the occurrence of psychoactive substance abuse among first-episode psychotic individuals using standard toxicological testing. We study the prevalence of cannabis and alcohol abuse among first-psychoticepisode inpatients as well as compare the demographic, diagnostic, and psychopathological profiles of substance abusers versus nonusers. METHODS. Subjects were recruited from the Jerusalem Mental Health Center between 2012 and 2014. Ninety-one consecutively admitted psychiatric patients diagnosed using the DSM-IV criteria with a first psychotic episode due to schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, bipolar disorder, brief psychotic episode, and psychosis NOS disorder entered the study. The diagnoses of schizophrenia (all types), psychosis NOS disorder, brief psychotic episode, and schizophreniform disorder were categorized as ""only psychosis"" and those of bipolar disorder manic episode with psychotic features (congruent and incongruent) and severe depression with psychotic features were categorized as ""predominantly affective symptoms."" Urine tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) were performed during the first 48 hours of admission, and likewise self-report questionnaires were administered. Alcohol abuse and dependence were diagnosed by self-report. RESULTS. Of the 91 subjects in the study, 49 (53.8%) did not abuse any illegal psychoactive substance. Twenty patients (22%) abused only cannabis; 14 (15.4%) abused cannabis and another psychoactive substance; 54 (59.3%) of the subjects reported no alcohol abuse; 33 (36.3%) reported occasional drinking (between two and ten times a month); and 4 (4.4%) reported continuous repeated drinking (more than ten times a month). There was no correlation between the demographic characteristics and the abuse of cannabis.

Also, the event-related synchronisation (ERS) of motor-associated high gamma was studied using a self-paced button press task (nвЂ‰=вЂ‰15). RESULTS. In the resting state, there was a significant condition Г— frequency interaction (pвЂ‰=вЂ‰0.00017), consisting of a shift towards higher frequencies under THC conditions (reduced high beta [21-27В Hz] and increased low gamma [27-45В Hz]).

6444,[!] Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol decreases somatic and motivational manifestations of nicotine withdrawal in mice.,15548217,,2004,"The possible interactions between Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta9-THC) and nicotine remain unclear in spite of the current association of cannabis and tobacco in humans. The aim of the present study was to explore the interactions between these two drugs of abuse by evaluating the consequences of Delta9-THC administration on the somatic manifestations and the aversive motivational state associated with nicotine withdrawal in mice. Acute Delta9-THC administration significantly decreased the incidence of several nicotine withdrawal signs precipitated by mecamylamine or naloxone, such as wet-dog-shakes, paw tremor and scratches.

6507,[!] Hepatotoxicity upon using niacin to pass a drug test: A case report.,29941333,,2018,"OBJECTIVE. To report a case of hepatotoxicity when niacin was used by a patient with HIV to pass a drug test. METHODS. Niacin is a soluble pyridine derivative widely used in the management of dyslipidemia. Common adverse effects include flushing, nausea, gastrointestinal discomfort, and hepatotoxicity. The use of niacin for nonmedical purposes has been increasing in prevalence in recent years, particularly in attempts to alter or mask results of urine drug tests. Although there is no scientific evidence that niacin can alter a urine drug screen result, easily retrievable information exists on the Internet touting niacin as a potential way to prevent detection of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The following report describes a case of hepatotoxicity in an HIV-infected adult who reported using niacin to mask THC in urine drug screen results. RESULTS. The patient developed marked elevations in his liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase greater than 25 times the upper limit of normal and alanine aminotransferase greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal) that resolved after discontinuation of the drug.

OBJECTIVE. To report a case of hepatotoxicity when niacin was used by a patient with HIV to pass a drug test. METHODS. Niacin is a soluble pyridine derivative widely used in the management of dyslipidemia. Common adverse effects include flushing, nausea, gastrointestinal discomfort, and hepatotoxicity. The use of niacin for nonmedical purposes has been increasing in prevalence in recent years, particularly in attempts to alter or mask results of urine drug tests. Although there is no scientific evidence that niacin can alter a urine drug screen result, easily retrievable information exists on the Internet touting niacin as a potential way to prevent detection of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The following report describes a case of hepatotoxicity in an HIV-infected adult who reported using niacin to mask THC in urine drug screen results. RESULTS. The patient developed marked elevations in his liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase greater than 25 times the upper limit of normal and alanine aminotransferase greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal) that resolved after discontinuation of the drug. Because of the patient's self-reported use and discontinuation of niacin, the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale demonstrated a ""definite"" relationship between the development of hepatotoxicity and the ingestion of over-the-counter sustained-release niacin. The patient did not develop further clinical abnormalities proposed to be secondary to niacin toxicity in previously published case reports, including glucose abnormalities, coagulopathies, metabolic acidosis, QTc prolongation, and myalgias.

At adulthood, rats were tested in the novel object recognition, social interaction, and forced swim tests, to evaluate possible alterations in recognition memory, social behavior, and coping strategy. Moreover, cannabinoid CB1 receptor density and functionality, as well as NMDA and dopamine D1 and D2 receptor densities were measured through autoradiographic binding studies.

6714,[!] Cannabinoids enhance susceptibility of immature brain to ethanol neurotoxicity.,18067175,,2008,"OBJECTIVE. Marijuana and alcohol are most widely abused drugs among women of reproductive age. Neurocognitive deficits have been reported in children whose mothers used marijuana during pregnancy. Maternal consumption of ethanol is known to cause serious developmental deficits. METHODS. Infant rats and mice received systemic injections of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; 1-10mg/kg) or the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 (1-10mg/kg), alone or in combination with subtoxic and toxic ethanol doses, and apoptotic neurodegeneration was studied in the brains. RESULTS. Acute administration of THC (1-10mg/kg), the principal psychoactive cannabinoid of marijuana, markedly enhanced proapoptotic properties of ethanol in the neonatal rat brain. THC did not induce neurodegeneration when administered alone. Neuronal degeneration became disseminated and severe when THC was combined with a mildly intoxicating ethanol dose (3gm/kg), with the effect of this drug combination resembling the massive apoptotic death observed when administering ethanol alone at much higher doses. The detrimental effect of THC was mimicked by the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 (1-10mg/kg) and counteracted by the CB(1) receptor antagonist SR141716A (0.4mg/kg). THC enhanced the proapoptotic effect of the GABA(A) agonist phenobarbital and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist dizocilpine.

OBJECTIVE. Marijuana and alcohol are most widely abused drugs among women of reproductive age. Neurocognitive deficits have been reported in children whose mothers used marijuana during pregnancy. Maternal consumption of ethanol is known to cause serious developmental deficits. METHODS. Infant rats and mice received systemic injections of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; 1-10mg/kg) or the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 (1-10mg/kg), alone or in combination with subtoxic and toxic ethanol doses, and apoptotic neurodegeneration was studied in the brains. RESULTS. Acute administration of THC (1-10mg/kg), the principal psychoactive cannabinoid of marijuana, markedly enhanced proapoptotic properties of ethanol in the neonatal rat brain. THC did not induce neurodegeneration when administered alone. Neuronal degeneration became disseminated and severe when THC was combined with a mildly intoxicating ethanol dose (3gm/kg), with the effect of this drug combination resembling the massive apoptotic death observed when administering ethanol alone at much higher doses. The detrimental effect of THC was mimicked by the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 (1-10mg/kg) and counteracted by the CB(1) receptor antagonist SR141716A (0.4mg/kg). THC enhanced the proapoptotic effect of the GABA(A) agonist phenobarbital and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist dizocilpine. Interestingly, infant CB(1) receptor knock-out mice were less susceptible to the neurotoxic effect of ethanol. Furthermore, the CB(1) receptor antagonist SR141716A ameliorated neurotoxicity of ethanol. CONCLUSIONS. These observations indicate that CB(1) receptor activation modulates GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission and primes the developing brain to suffer apoptotic neuronal death."
